# Rating-Prediction-for-Car-Reviews
I compare the impact of sentiment score of review text, overall rating and chunk parsing on aspect rating prediction. The best outcome is achieved when using chunk parsing to divide sentences describing more than one aspect into specific chunks, then take sentiment score of those chunks and sentences depicting one aspect as input, with addition of the overall rating.

ipynb files are code for data scraping, counting and analyzing, sentiment analysis.
