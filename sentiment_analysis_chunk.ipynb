      "10027 This is a great car but beware before purchasing - I'm only at 3,000 miles and my tires almost need to be replaced! At this rate, you could spend thousands of dollars extra on tires every year. I love the car but am dissatisfied with a few things--the standard sound package is not up to par or comparable with other luxury brands--low-end features for the price of the car; also, at my 2,500 mile tuneup and oil change, they let me know that the tires almost need to be replaced and I've only been driving the car for 3,000 miles--unacceptable! At that rate, I'll have to purchase four new sets of tires per year. I have never heard of such a thing and would be much less likely to buy this car again, or recommend it to a friend, based on this issue. Jul 24, 2016I am 1000% pleased with the car's performance and reliability, thus far. I have just a few minor issues, such as the fact that the options on the standard sound system--in this new luxury car--seem to not be on par for standard sound systems for 1-2 year old NON-luxury brand cars. In other words, at this level, there is no excuse for the standard sound system to be a \"dial\" and not a touch screen style stereo. The sound is good, but it's totally antiquated. Additionally, I would comment that the front seat can be a bit of a challenge to get out of at times, and seems a little cramped at times. Thank you.\n"

      "One of the difficulties with the audio system is that you cannot connect a new phone via bluetooth while driving: that means if a passenger wants to stream a song to you car speakers, you must use an auxiliary cable.\n",
      "The trunk will make a beeping noise and immediately unlatch to avoid accidentally trapping the key inside.\n",
      "You can unlock the door from the outside just by having the key nearby your person.\n",
      "All you have to do is touch the door handle and it will unlock.\n",
      "If you start the car in cold weather and turn on the heat, the car will slowly blow air at first to avoid blasting you with cold air.\n",
      "Once the engine heats up, the air will gradually turn on.\n",
      "If keys for driver 1 and driver 2 are nearby, the vehicle will set the driver seating position to whomever's key is closes to the driver door when entering (or by who unlocks the car).\n",
      "The position between driver 1 and 2 can be switched while inside by simply holding the profile button on the driver door.\n",
      "The speakers will adjust volume based on road noise and engine loudness.\n",
      "It is everything you need in a car to get you from point-A to point-B reliably, comfortably, safe, and stylishly.\n",
      "It features quality materials, economical mileage, smooth transmission, excellent safety features, power when you need it, and an overall quiet ride.\n",
      "The features and quality of the sound system are incredible (ILX Tech-Plus).\n",
      "I would not recommend you buy this car if your passengers are quite large, if you need excessive cargo space, or if you plan to go very long distances with adult passengers in the back seat.\n",
      "In the front seats I have plenty of legroom and the seats are comfortable.\n",

      "Car is great with acceleration, but sometimes I feel there is too large of a delay between pressing the gas pedal down and engine response.\n",
      "I value performance in a vehicle, but this con was not enough to make me not consider this vehicle.\n",
      "I love the car but am dissatisfied with a few things--the standard sound package is not up to par or comparable with other luxury brands--low-end features for the price of the car; also, at my 2,500 mile tuneup and oil change, they let me know that the tires almost need to be replaced and I've only been driving the car for 3,000 miles--unacceptable!\n",
      "Jul 24, 2016I am 1000% pleased with the car's performance and reliability, thus far.\n",
      "I have just a few minor issues, such as the fact that the options on the standard sound system--in this new luxury car--seem to not be on par for standard sound systems for 1-2 year old NON-luxury brand cars.\n",
      "In other words, at this level, there is no excuse for the standard sound system to be a \"dial\" and not a touch screen style stereo.\n",
      "Additionally, I would comment that the front seat can be a bit of a challenge to get out of at times, and seems a little cramped at times.\n",
      "Love that there is no hump in the back seat floor.\n",
      "Love that when you look out the windshield when driving you don't see the hood.\n",
      "Love the blinker can be touched and will blink 3 times and don't have to turn it back off when changing lanes.\n",
      "Love the lights on the side mirrors and beeping when changing lanes and there is a car there.\n",
      "Talk through the speakers when on the phone!\n",
      "But I think the 2 things that I really like about my car is the feel of the steering wheel and the sound of the stereo!!\n",
      "EXCELLENT SOUND and EXCELLENT FEEL OF THE WHEEL!\n",
      "On the screen, when a song is playing it has the band name and then the song title all on one line.\n",
      "But because there is not enough room on that one line the song title always gets cut off if it's too long because there's not enough room.\n",
      "I recommend putting the song title on the next line so it gets the space of the whole line rather than half a line and it won't get cut off and you can read the whole title.\n",
      "Be careful about the low visibility and check to be sure that it has all the features you are looking for and don't assume they are present because it's a \"luxury\" brand.\n",
      "The car does not have a number of features like turn signals on the outsider mirrors that one would expect of an Acura.\n",
      "a car that purports to be even semi luxurious/upscale should have clearance lights in the front doors and heated mirrors and lumbar support to name just a few things that this car does NOT have.\n",
      "Good technology and fun to drive.\n",
      "I love the car but wish some of the technology was more reliable.\n",
      "The safety and technology advanced features are really good and perform well.\n",
      "I have had two minor problems with the NAVI system and problem with the automatic button labeling on the audio system.\n",
      "Car Overall = I expected a smoother drive, not being aware about the eight gears\r\n",
      "Futures = my backup camera did not respond a few times and once got stuck, thermometer was destabilized when the outside temperature went over 80F.\n",
      "When it rains, and the driver window is lightly open while driving - all the water from the roof gets channeled right into the window.\n",
      "So even if the window is open for a quarter of an inch, and it's not even rain hard, whatever water that gets collected on the roof goes straight into the salon like from a tap.\n",
      "Also something is wrong with rear speakers - the sound is dull and muffled in the back, it's great in the front.\n",
      "Would like to see hatchback or sport wagon in the future, as well as inclusion of electric supported engine.\n",
      "Would also love to see Acura lean more heavily into electric or alternative fuels while still preserving the feeling of gear selection.\n",
      "The interior is comfortable and luxurious.\n",
      "I love the back up camera.\n",
      "I wish there was a camera in the front so I know how close I am.\n",
      "It feels smooth, however sometimes jerks forward when you ease the gas pedal.\n",
      "Talking on the phone is easy and convenient.\n",
      "It accelerates and brakes quickly.\n",
      "There are constant air noises and the USB cable connection does not work properly.\n",
      "Air either filters in through the doors/windows or out when driving over 60.\n",
      "The vehicle is significantly over priced\r\n",
      "Disappointed in the selection on no spare tire they have made\r\n",
      "Disappointed with limited selection of tech packages offerred.\n",
      "Pleather  seats should not be offered; quality cloth seats would be far better.\n",
      "I wish the seats were leather and not suede and I wish the interior were parchment rather than black.\n",
      "Jan 30, 2016I wish my seats were full leather rather than the suede combo that it has.\n",
      "Also, I wish the interior were a brighter color - I do not like the black interior and wish I had had the choice of parchment.\n",
      "This car is a complete disappointment to me and I can't wait for the lease to be up so I can get rid of it.\n",
      "After previously owning a 2012 TL, I miss the power when I drive.\n",
      "I am sorry that the ILX doesn't have all leather seats.\n",
      "Very fun to drive and excellent on gas.\n",
      "When I roll down the passenger side window there's a high pitch whistling noise, as when wind is seeping through a crack, which is VERY annoying.\n",
      "Also theirs a flapping sound coming from the engine and lots of road vibrations inside.\n",
      "Noticed they took out seat memory which should be a base feature.\n",
      "I also feel that, today, for the price of even the base model,  blind spot warning, lane drift warning, and back of warning should be included as they're safety features.\n",
      "I think vehicle should have a spare tire, the reliability of vehicle is reduced when you don't feel safe in a long trip, due to trip interruption, and hoping you don't get  a tire damaged on sidewall , very disappointed with spare tire condition ( none).\n",
      "Also, simple things like light on AC button if on could be nice.\n",
      "I'm not sure if this auto has lived up to what I was hoping with regards to mileage..\n",
      "This is the worst on board voice activation system I have ever expierienced big failure among other things with the car, shame on me for not feeling a little more comfortable with the car before I signed the lease.\n",
      "The heater does not heat up as fast as the 2013 ILX did -have not tested air conditioning yet\r\n",
      "Bad gas mileage if the outside temperature is under 50 degrees F\r\n",
      "Engine sound is loud.\n",
      "I am getting 29 miles per gallon (3,700 miles on the car), it has 204 horsepower, the leather interior is great.\n",
      "No frills but purposeful/useful luxurious technology (back up camera, blue tooth audio, etc.\n",
      "The car has no back up sensor which is strange considering all the technology in the car.\n",
      "Would have been nice to get folding in mirrors again kind of surprised given the tech level of car.\n",
      "There is a rattle from within my wheel that I had to get fixed, and I have heard it in several late model Acuras.\n",
      "Feb 3, 2016I have 6000 miles on my new ILX and there is an soft, yet annoying, noise coming from the dash.\n",
      "Very easy to drive and park, feels safe and comfortable in all 4 seats, and is also quite attractive / stylish both interiorly and exteriorly.\n",
      "Thank you for your careful design and safety features.\n",
      "Please add:\r\n",
      "real leather to the ILX as standard equipment\r\n",
      "MORE active sound deadening\r\n",
      "SOFTER ride, since it is not an impressive handling car (not designed for it)\r\n",
      "$0 down lease promotions.\n",
      "I am VERY disappointed with the lack of a spare tire as well as the Acura Roadside Assistance program.\n",
      "Was hesitant to buy it, because I have always driven German cars, but once I saw the styling, interior, and test drove it, I was hooked!\n",
      "I feel posh while driving it and the exterior lights and body shape are beautiful.\n",
      "The ILX is not as nice, rides not as good, tires are cheaper and thin, interior not as nice or roomy, and main compartments are not available.\n",
      "Few design changes i would recommend (center console fits HORRIBLY on the drivers side under the radio) and no sunglass holder or home link?\n",
      "I drive alone about 90% of the time so I don't need a lot of extra room or are concerned about the comfort of back seat passengers.\n",
      "Two features that I don't care for are: (1) Lack of spare or run flat tire (just has a flat tire kit), and (2) lack of lumbar support.\n",
      "I was very disappointed that the navigation is not at easy to use as any of the products I use on my smart phone.\n",
      "It is luxury in an affordable price range.\n",
      "I love driving my vehicle in that it feels luxurious yet sporty.\n",
      "PUT THE LUMBAR ADJUSTMENT AND INTERIOR STORAGE SPACE BACK IN THE CAR.\n",
      "The one option missing that I feel is important is  Warning light in mirrors to warn passing vehicles.\n",
      "Handles well, has more than adequate power, over all quality is high in fit and finish.\n",
      "problem 1: very low idle, feels like engine may stall\r\n",
      "problem 2: Airbags.\n",
      "great gas mileage, sporty feel and fun to drive.\n",
      "Love the ride, acceleration and look.\n",
      "If you place th Acura name on a vehicle, it should meet a standard level of quality and not feel cheap.\n",
      "They are safe, high-quality, and offer all kinds of technological goodies.\n",
      "The car needs air vent for back seat.\n",
      "AWD is a necessary feature.\n",
      "I have a front wheel drive MDX.\n",
      "I will soon trade it in and get an AWD, which better suits my driving style.\n",
      "The vehicle is too heavy for front wheel drive only.\n",
      "The steering wheel is too big.\n",
      "Can't see when the parking brake light is on or off with out looking for it.\n",
      "I'm not feeling the push-button transmission, and the engine is still too noisy, but I can get past that.\n",
      "Road noise is a bit loud but overall I still like.\n",
      "I need a pearl white AWD MDX with the same features or better with an burnt orange interior or something close.\n",
      "Oh and upgrade the backup camera to what the RLX has.\n",
      "I am really missing my AWD and my back up collision warning and my auto retracting mirrors.\n",
      "I am still trying to get use to the exterior color, but I'll get there.\n",
      "An extremely versatile vehicle, comfortable, fun to drive, fuel efficient, good looking.\n",
      "As I've gotten used to all the tech features and larger size of the vehicle, I am extremely comfortable driving it and am very proud of it.\n",
      "Apr 8, 2016 My only disappointment is the when using the voice command for navigation, the system doesn't understand and creates much frustration.\n",
      "Otherwise I love driving this, and as an active grandmother of five children, three with car seats, this vehicle allows me to cart them easily.\n",
      "Mar 2, 2016After driving this vehicle for three months, I am still trying to feel comfortable driving it.\n",
      "Thank goodness for lane assist.\n",
      "I do love it's interior comfort and versatility, but have to say I wouldn't recommend this vehicle because of the ease of using its technology, which I was warned about by reading reviews, but just didn't believe since many people complain about everything.\n",
      "Despite the transmission, the car has lots of great technology, safety features, and is fun to drive.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016The safety features are amazing.\n",
      "Wish the lane departure, STOP warning, blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control sound levels were customizable and unique from each other.\n",
      "Wish there was a sound when the lane keeping assist system detected and lost the lane.\n",
      "LKAS should have the option to continue to function without driver needing to provide steering input.\n",
      "This was supposed to be my comfortable road trip car, but the engine has a high-pitched whine that is driving me insane to the point where I can't even drive it.\n",
      "The radio is terrible and does not sound like a \"premium package\" to me.\n",
      "One time I had my foot off the gas, and my body was thrown forward against the steering wheel.\n",
      "Some features you expect from a luxury vehicle are missing, but are present in non luxury brand, Honda.\n",
      "E.g digital speedometer reading Update your software to include digital speedometer on center dash (numeric).\n",
      "Far less expensive brands offer this feature, it makes the dash look incredibly dated and is a feature I've come to expect in a luxury vehicle.\n",
      "May 7, 2018Incorporate a heads up display and a DIGITAL NUMBERED SPEEDOMETER readout on the dash.\n",
      "You already have a digital dash, that should be an option and quite frankly, you should offer this software update to those who have already purchased your vehicle.\n",
      "This feature was available in Honda civics in the mid 2000's, if you want to be a luxury brand, you need to also offer the most basic features.\n",
      "Overall, a bold, stylish ride, with comfort, power, safety, etc.\n",
      "Ability to have a sun visor that will fully extend the length of the driver side window and a heads-up display in the windshield.\n",
      "The heated steering wheel and fold-in side mirrors were great additions to the 2017 model.\n",
      "Needs buttons to control fan speed, radio tuning, and seat heaters.\n",
      "Second row seating area should have at least one power outlet.\n",
      "Fog lights should be standard in a car with this price range.\n",
      "And these days, you'd expect a bigger roof window.\n",
      "The value for the luxury is unsurpassable on the ACURA MDX vs the other brands I test drove: BMW X5 and Land Rover Velar.\n",
      "The seats and leather are very comfortable however the plastic casing on my cell phone in my back pocket easily make a small tear in the seat.\n",
      "When going over water puddles the wheel wells collect more water and noise than the typical cars I have driven.\n",
      "More Horsepower with fuel efficiency.\n",
      "Overall the vehicle is a good value especially compared to other luxury brands.\n",
      "It has a conservative interior and exterior that could use some further refinement.\n",
      "Jan 19, 2018The interior needs to be updated to compete with other luxury brands.\n",
      "The MDX would could also use a sportier look and more autonomous driving features would be nice.\n",
      "Driver's seat is terrible.\n",
      "Steering wheel adjustment is terrible.\n",
      "Many good aspects, however, I really do not like the \"driving\" experience, because I am uncomfortable as the driver.\n",

      "I love the smooth ride and innovative features.\n",
      "Order it with a suspension system ---because mine rides like an old GM product with  badly worn shocks; don't leave it in the sun too long for fear of it melting the Styrofoam used in some of the structure,like behind the grill, and for God's sake, don't wear boots when driving because you are likely to step on both pedals simultaneously due to the close proximity of one another.\n",
      "Oh, one more thing ---get Audi to put a real size engine in this All-road  and bring the price down about 10k!\n",
      "Yeah, Why is there a clunking noise whenever I stop at a traffic light.\n",
      "Now I just use siri voice commands to make phone calls when I'm driving.\n",
      "It is very distracting to have so many buttons on the steering wheel and in the dash board.\n",
      "I don't feel like the car's sensors are ready to replace my eyes for being able to drive.\n",
      "The sensor's really can't see or evaluate what an object is and makes the wrong judgement about.\n",
      "The few poorly conceived details [opaque driver controls] and poorly executed items [interior door arm rests] are not enough to diminish my opinion, but they should be corrected.\n",

      "A5 Sportback is a well-engineered technology-packed car that seems well made and feels relatively luxurious.\n",
      "Ride quality is a little rough, gas mileage isn't quite as good as advertised and road noise is a little loud but overall it is a very nice high-quality vehicle that delivers a lot of value even at a luxury price point.\n",
      "Also the compaiblity on cell phone and email is less than was would be expected with a car of this value.\n",
      "The sensors are annoying in cold / freezing weather.\n",
      "S-line version should come with 19 inch wheel as standard.\n",
      "The front-end sensor is easily displaced and beeps at off times.\n",
      "The interior ambient lighting should be 560 nanometer, which is a cherry red color, not cool white.\n",
      "For the human eye, this translates into it being the single least physiologically distracting color in the visible light spectrum.\n",
      "The cool white ambient lighting currently used is very garish and distracting.\n",
      "The current ambient lighting illuminates the side armrests too brightly and the footwells not brightly enough (see bullet 1A).\n",
      "Take those two red LEDs from the overhead console that illuminate the forward part of the center console, put another set of identical ones under the mirror (just like my VW Passat had), another set further aft, perhaps behind the moonroof, to illuminate the aft part of the front seat area's center console, and put another set in the rear seat area's overhead console to not only illuminate the reading light buttons, but also to illuminate the center area of the back seat.\n",
      "Then, use that same red color in the already-existing ambient lighting areas to replace the cool white.\n",
      "Leave the white lighting for the miscellaneous stuff on the dashboard (actually, I really liked the blue that VW used to use that they have since replaced with white; that blue was beautiful!\n",
      "Better yet, for Audi, make the miscellaneous white dashboard lighting currently used to be driver changeable to blue, green, red, yellow, cool white, or warm white - but don't get carried away with too many choices the way Ford did with the Mustang.\n",
      "Honda features all LED interior lighting.\n",

      "However the rear reading lamp buttons, the cruise control stock, and windshield wiper stocks aren't.\n",
      "I don't know anyone who would prefer a cruise control stock over having the cruise control buttons on the steering wheel.\n",
      "My VW had internally illuminated, steering wheel mounted, cruise control buttons.\n",
      "And at that, see bullet 1D; if you insist on using a stock instead of steering wheel buttons then couldn't you at least have internally illuminated it?\n",
      "The door armrests don't extent far enough aft.\n",
      "On my A6, I have the steering wheel all the way aft.\n",
      "At 5'10\", I'm very average sized, yet my right elbow has to rest on the very far forward left corner of the center armrest in order to be able to simultaneously rest my arm and reach the steering wheel.\n",
      "Most people won't be able to simultaneously rest their right arm on the armrest and steer with their right hand.\n",
      "And if your seat is too far aft, the side armrests become unusable.\n",
      "Audi needs to at least have the option of seat cooling on all their cars and if not, then standard on every model.\n",
      "My parents had seat cooling on their 2005 Toyota Avalon that cost, adjusted for inflation, half of what my A6 cost.\n",
      "I find myself turning up the air conditioning until I'm freezing cold yet somehow, the parts of my body that are in contact with the leather seat are hot and sweaty.\n",
      "Seat cooling would fix that.\n",
      "The regular visor for regular use, and, when pivoted to the door to block side glare, a second visor that comes down to block forward glare.\n",
      "Wow, that trunk size is very much at the expense of rear seat leg room.\n",
      "The rear seat should be six inches further aft with the trunk shrunk respectively.\n",
      "The A6 clearly has less rear seat leg room than my VW Passat had.\n",
      "I'm intrigued that the steering wheel is electrically adjustable as standard equipment yet the steering wheel heating is optional even though the heating would cost Audi less than the electrically adjustable steering wheel.\n",
      "Given a choice, free of charge, I'd take the steering wheel heating any day of the week over the electric steering wheel position adjustment.\n",
      "Ever use steering wheel heating on a freezing cold day?\n",
      "On a car costing over $50K, I'd like to see more interior and exterior color offerings.\n",
      "Audi used to make beautiful pearlescent paint; where did that go?!?\n",
      "They also used to make a very sharp emerald green paint; beautiful!\n",
      "Make mine an Air Canada'ish pearlescent blue exterior with a two-toned powder and navy blue interior!\n",
      "I only have 200 miles, all highway, and I've averaged over 38 MPG; not too shabby on a full-sized, all wheel drive sedan!\n",
      "The door armrests don't extend far enough aft.\n",
      "Put the cruise controls as illuminated buttons on the steering wheel where they belong, not on a cheap cruise control stock.\n",
      "One of these days I'm going to accidentally break the cruise control stock completely off the steering column with my left knee and it will inevitably cost hundreds to have it reinstalled.\n",
      "Audi used to use all red interior lighting and it looked so much better.\n",
      "The ambient lighting brightly illuminates the door armrests in a garish white light (red would have been MUCH better) making it look like Las Vegas.\n",
      "But then, only the door armrests are \"ambient\" illuminated; the rest of the interior isn't.\n",
      "On the same rheostat control, the footwell ambient lighting is far dimmer than the door rest armrests - again fix the uniformity of lighting intensities!\n",
      "The door armrests seem like a puzzlingly random place for all this extra ambient lighting when the rest of the interior is blackened out.\n",
      "Put those elsewhere in the interior, including the rear seat area; they look great.\n",
      "I've since modified my A6's interior dome and reading lamps with aftermarket LEDs and it now looks SIGNIFICANTLY better and is a lot slower to drain the battery if inadvertently left on.\n",
      "The rear seat reading lamp buttons aren't illuminated.\n",
      "Puzzling choice to use an all electric steering column adjustment but to make steering wheel heating optional.\n",
      "The all electric steering column adjustment would cost more than adding steering wheel heating.\n",
      "I'd rather have steering wheel heating along with a manual steering column adjuster.\n",
      "For instance, in order to access the back-up camera menu I have to be actively shifted into reverse.\n",
      "Simultaneously, a separate green \"cruise\" light illuminates and remains illuminated.\n",
      "It would have been cheaper to just leave the green \"cruise\" annunciation, along with the set cruise control speed, on the digital screen and completely foregone the separate green \"cruise\" light.\n",
      "2) Make the engine auto-shutdown/restart feature an optional mode and not the default mode on the cars on which you provide this feature.\n",
      "3) Make the automatic parking brake actuation that occurs when the drivers door open a feature that can be turned off in MMSÃ¢ÂÂsometimes it very helpful to be able to partially open the driver door to look at the pavement or the curb when parking the car in tight spaces.\n",
      "But really, I don't drive this car every day, let alone use the service enough to pay ~ $16/month for the service.\n",
      "Even if you are willing to pay for an additional SiriusXM radio to use in your home, in addition to the radio that Audi puts in the car so that you could make more use of the SiriusXM service, you get virtually no discount for having a second radio.\n",
      "Audi and the other auto manufactures that put SiriusXM radios in their vehicles should collectively pressure SiriusXM to be more reasonable in its pricing.\n",
      "My option is to drop the SiriusXM service altogether, which then means having a feature in my nice new relatively expensive upscale car that doesn't work.\n",
      "2) Put four-way climate control in all your cars instead of the three-way system that is in mine, or at least provide the same control panel on the dash as the four-way system.\n",
      "I have the three-way system,in my new A6, and its two cheap looking temperature control knobs with their tiny temperature labels are hard to read.\n",
      "This control seems cheap and cheesy when compared to the appearance of the 4-way climate control system, which by the way looks similar to what's in my 2003 Audi A4 3.0 MT6 (which I still do own).\n",
      "3) I hate the engine auto-stop feature.\n",
      "I'm grateful I can defeat it manually by pushing a button on the dash, but I wish the default for the system was \"off\" and not \"on\" every time I start the car.\n",
      "That button to turn it off is going to look awfully worn relative the rest of the controls on the dash by the time this car gets to the middle of its life.\n",
      "4) I miss the days when Audi put a full size spare with matching wheel rim in the trunk.\n",
      "Just know that this engineer with 45 years of driving experience has resorted to using spare tires several times over the course of the years.\n",
      "Please, please, please, don't ever adopt what Cadillac and BMW are now doing with their new sedansÃ¢ÂÂpulling the spare tires out altogether and fitting the cars with run-flat tires, which don't perform as well as conventional tires, as far as road noise and handling are concerned.\n",
      "A can of goo to inject into a tire and a small electric compressor that gets its power from an on-board 12V utility outlet is a poor solution, too.\n",
      "But the comfort, technology, and safety features of my 2016 Audi A6 Prestige changed that.\n",
      "And the safety features make me far more confidence in traffic and when parking.\n",
      "Sadly, after owning it just six weeks and driving only 2300 miles, another driver made a U-turn across a four-lane highway and pulled in front of me, leaving me only 25 feet to stop.\n",
      "I used to hate to drive.\n",
      "And I love the safety features, which were a principal reason for looking at this car.\n",
      "These safety features were hugely important in my decision to purchase this car.\n",
      "I traded in an otherwise  flawless luxury car with low mileage to get these safety features, and I bought the top model A6 to get all of them.\n",
      "But now that I am retired, and the outcome of my previous employment, saving, and investment decisions has been successful, I am quite comfortable purchasing a car that costs twice as much as I have ever spent on a car previously, simply because I can comfortably afford it and want the safety and comfort that a top of the line A6 provides.\n",
      "When I first saw it after it had been delivered, I fell in love with it immediately.\n",
      "Create a heated gear shift lever to go with current heated steering wheel.\n",
      "More air flow through ventilated seats and back.\n",
      "Apr 12, 2016Need to add a blind spot mirror in a portion of the drivers outside mirror like Ford has in their vehicles.\n",
      "Feb 4, 2016In addition the heated steering wheel option I have on my car, I would like to see a heated gear shift lever.\n",
      "Additionally, I would like to see the following: External Windshield De-Icing System, Heated Windshield Wipers (arms and blades), Heated Windshield Washer Fluid, Electric De-Frosting/De-Fogging Front Windshield Like the Rear Window, Remote Starter (from 400 yards away), Steering Wheel that Moves Up and In when Shut Off Engine, Dashboard and System Settings that Stay where Set when Engine Shut Off at Start Up.\n",
      "It handles exceptionally well no matter the road or driving conditions.\n",
      "The electronics are fairly simple to operate, including personalizing the vehicle by connecting your cell phone or other types of music connections.\n",
      "The vehicle is very comfortable to drive, the engine is quite adequate for the car as is the braking system.\n",
      "I hope Audi stays ahead of the competition, but makes some price adjustments to their cars and various trim level packages, because the competitors are closing in when it comes to style, performance, technology & dependability.\n",
      "I've also had a connection problem with the USB ports and my cell phone (Samsung Note 4) that does not provide charging to my phone even though the phone shows that it's connected and should be charging.\n",
      "A6 has an excellent ride, holds the road well, and is fun to drive.\n",
      "Drawbacks are confusing audio/ voice active controls, lack of driver console storage space, no sunglass holder, no touchscreen controls, and the run-stop-system is annoying.\n",
      "Glove box is small, center armrest has less storage than most, console has cupholders and a small ashtray sized storage area, and then there is driver door storage.\n",
      "I use my cellphone a lot when driving.\n",
      "Great combination of performance, luxury and utility in a reliable, versatile and interesting vehicle.\n",
      "Integration of the Navigation System with addresses already stored on a Smart-Phone would be very useful.\n",
      "My car has very nice looking larger wheels, but the lower-profile side-walls of the tires result in a less smooth and noisier ride.\n",
      "I purchased the A6 with the 2.0T engine to ensure that horsepower was manageable for my children.\n",
      "The braking modulation is also totally different as the brakes on the A4 just felt like they could erase speed at a touch of the pedal.\n",
      "Since my kids often drive the vehicle I decided that less horsepower would be better as they are inexperienced drivers.\n",
      "However the ride quality and handling is still top notch.\n",
      "Maybe too highly electronic so things come on the dash such as \"low pressure in tires\" and it isn't necessarily true.\n",
      "Would love a button to touch on trunk door so trunk goes down without pulling it down by hand.\n",
      "Safety and handling are exceptional for its car class.\n",
      "Oct 15, 2016I miss automatic door locking when I park.\n",
      "I miss the driver seat automatically going back when I park.\n",
      "The controls on the console are a little low to use when driving.\n",
      "The transmission and gas mileage are awesome.\n",
      "Audi should change the side mirror heating switch as currently you have to remember to turn the switch off otherwise the heaters stay on.\n",
      "Also heaters should automatically turn off after 30 minutes or so.........OR use the rear window heater switch to heat the side mirrors as well as that does everything mentioned.\n",
      "Engine is extremely quiet with no sound increase under hard acceleration.\n",
      "It's slow to re-start the engine and has once stalled on me, forcing me to put the car in park and press the start button to get the engine going again, then put back into drive and pull away.\n",
      "Mar 23, 2016The Audi A6 provided the proper mix of comfort, styling and power.\n",
      "As an engineer and a mechanic I have a few comments for other improvements and features I'd like to provide to the engineering team.\n",
      "Smooth ride, comfortable seats, great handling, plenty of power from the 2.0 turbo, lots of nice convenience features, great sound system, good head and leg room for someone 6'-2\",  door opening high enough so that it's not too difficult getting in and out of.\n",
      "make sure the flaw in the audio software has been resolved.\n",
      "i am very disappointed that, after 4 months, the audio software continues to malfunction when the car is put in reverse.\n",
      "I wish the tire option would allow me to have choose a 16 or 17 inch wheel.\n",
      "Since I don't use the car to road race the 18 or 19 inch wheels seem to be over kill or just for optics.\n",
      "Offer a V8 engine option for the A6, get rid of the need to deactivate the fuel saving feature so the car ride can be enjoyed and fix the hump in the back seat so the car can truly carry 5 passengers.\n",
      "The back seat cannot accommodate 3 people in comfort.\n",
      "Recommend they install larger cup holders and a 110/120v plug for occupants to use when travelling.\n",
      "Blind spot monitor should have option of a verbal sound as well as the tug on the steering wheel.\n",
      "The standard seats are not as comfortable as they should be on this price range of car.\n",
      "We have owned many Audis, and the standard seats have gotten less comfortable over the last 15 years if anything.\n",
      "Only repair was a warning that my tire was under-inflated, and it was after I had the car for a weekendÃ¢ÂÂthe warning was correctÃ¢ÂÂthere was a nail in the tire.\n",
      "Jul 9, 2016Seat adjustment and steering wheel are important because I am short!\n",
      "Cupholders are too close together to handle to larger cups, and they are hard to find in the dark...how about a red LED in the cupholders?\n",
      "This is my 5th new Audi, great vehicle, handles well, safe and great gas mileage.\n",
      "I wish it had the acceleration and handling of the A7  with the ride and interior reduce noise level of the A8.\n",
      "The A6 is a top notch mid level luxury vehicle with the right amount of timeless style, comfort, surprising power with unexpected great fuel economy.\n",
      "Great performance/comfort and style for the money.\n",
      "Regarding the AC, I took possession of my A6 in November and have not had opportunity to use the AC yet as I live on the Northeast.\n",
      "Loved the Comfort close doors and push button trunk close!\n",
      "I did, however, want to carry less car around and wanted the option of lowering rear seats for luggage, cat and cargo.\n",
      "3.0T is a powerful and responsive platform when combined with the transmission.\n",
      "Quality interior craftsmanship are exactly why I picked an Audi!\n",
      "Seats in new A6 are not as comfortable as my old A6.\n",
      "Leather interior is not as high quality as my old A6.\n",
      "Vehicle is comfortable, impressive suite of safety equipment, excellent handling.\n",
      "The media/technology and ease of use could use some improvements.\n",
      "Very fast and comfortable ride.\n",
      "Great on gas, stylish, handles great, roomy, luxurious.\n",
      "My three Audi's are among the finest automobiles I have ever owned, from the standpoint of quality and technological innovation.\n",
      "Thoughtfully integrated, superb handling, respectably fast and subtle polished interior.\n",
      "Only three\r\n",
      "vehicle negatives; would thrash the engineer or greenie consultant who put start/stop as default, needs a rear window wiper and drive assist functions are, at best, annoying when on.\n",
      "Door pockets very narrow.\n",
      "The stop/start makes the motor run rougher and I've noticed a vibration in the wheel and foot pedal.\n",
      "Sep 24, 2016Why was the back-up camera changed from a full view on the 2014 Audi A7 to a three-quarter view with the overhead car view in the other quarter of the screen?\n",
      "The full-screen back-up camera view was much better.\n",
      "My Subaru has almost all of the same features, but is much easier to understand and use.\n",
      "Would like to option to customize the speed for the rear spoiler to automatically activate.\n",
      "The media volume is noticeably lower than that of the radio.\n",
      "The A7 is a dynamic car that offers comfort, reliability and style.\n",
      "Engineering and safety features are outstanding.\n",
      "Amazing, deep paint job and luxurious materials throughout!\n",
      "I would like to see a little larger glove box and a 180 degree back up camera view.\n",
      "Oct 15, 2016I think the back up camera should have the feature of viewing the cross traffic as well as directly behind the vehicle at the same time.\n",
      "Also, you can not download CD's to the radio's HDD due to copyright infringements.\n",
      "The car performs with phenomenal power, handling, quietness, comfort, appearance, seats, sound system, interior/exterior design, and materials.\n",
      "Tons of technology and amazing seat comfort (and support).\n",
      "When buying this car, make sure you look at reliability and overall service record and long term value retention on trade ins and resale.\n",
      "There is a very annoying \"whistle\" sound that is intermittent and can be heard while driving with the radio off and air con on low so there is no phone noise.\n",
      "Make the port useful for laptops and USB charging, but get rid of it.\n",
      "When you buy a $80,000 large sedan, I think storage and convenience shouldn't be such an afterthought.\n",
      "The blind spot warning system is sadly missing an audio alert in addition to the visual.\n",
      "Putting on the signal prior to lane change ( proper driving technique) does not require checking side mirror.\n",
      "Sound stops, safe to change lanes allowing driver to concentrate on forward progress and traffic.\n",
      "For instance, pulling into the garage you have to press a button so the warning sound comes on if too close to the wall.\n",
      "The warning sound should be automatic.\n",
      "The navigation system is user friendly, relatively easy to learn and use.\n",
      "I am very pleased with the Q3, but I would have liked to have a lighter color interior.\n",
      "Please offer a tan interior with a white exterior, because a black interior in south Texas can be brutal.\n",
      "Dec 9, 2016There are two things I'd change in my car...(1) the interior color from black to tan and (2) the color of the display because red is harsh, I would rather have blue.\n",
      "Oct 31, 2016Give at least one more option for a lighter interior color.\n",
      "A black interior in a climate that is warm most of the year is a difficult color to own.\n",
      "Problems that I have had include the tailgate button failure, AC not working one time, headlights were too low and needed to be adjusted, and my wheels were not properly aligned.\n",
      "I purchased the Q3 for the combination of beautiful styling and purported reliability.\n",
      "In the first two months of ownership, I have had two issues: power tailgate failure and air conditioner not working.\n",
      "I purchased the Q3 because it offered an economical and reliable vehicle to commute to work and drive cross country.\n",
      "There were issues concerning both comfort and safety.\n",
      "The ride on rough pavement was uncomfortable, a strong gust of wind pushed the car across the highway line, it was very difficult to defog front and side windows, and passengers over 6' tall were uncomfortable in the front and rear seats.\n",
      "I disliked driving the Q3 so much that I took the financial hit and am now paying the price with a larger auto loan.\n",
      "Since I didn't realize that my trunk lock was broken and the warning light didn't come on I ended up pulling out of my driveway and into the street and my truck popped open as I was making a left turn.\n",
      "Jun 24, 2016Although this is not a brand I have purchased before, I have purchased another brand that is made by the same company, and I loved the feel of it, and I had great memories from owning cars of that brand (VW).\n",
      "Specifically the comfort of the driver's seat, the accent lighting, and the sound system.\n",
      "When driving, I find the power steering to be excellent, but I suggest improving the turning radius.\n",
      "If there is any way Audi could provide a turbo that does not require PREMIUM fuel, that would help reduce cost of use.\n",
      "The interior colors are gorgeous.\n",
      "The side mirrors should be electronic to move them inward.\n",
      "Some interior wood trim and upgraded comfort seats would be very nice.\n",
      "Engine noise a little too loud.\n",
      "A larger 4 cylinder turbo might do the trick, but Audi needs to get closer to BMW when it comes to horsepower.\n",
      "One complaint is that the center console is too short, and my arm doesn't fall on it naturally.\n",
      "Outstanding in handling, safety and comfort.\n",
      "Exceptional performance in bad road conditions.\n",
      "Oct 23, 2016I am a small person and sit lower in the seat and the sun visors are not adequate for me I should like a way to extend them.\n",
      "I wish it had seat position memory feature.\n",
      "Sep 27, 2016I wish the Q3 had seat memory position buttons for the driver.\n",
      "I didn't realize what a hassle it is to adjust the vehicle seat position after different drivers.\n",
      "Mar 21, 2016Only recommendation I would make is to move the engine start/stop button, as it is very close to the driver's side heated seats, and I have pushed the wrong button before, causing the car to shut off.\n",
      "The Q3 is fun to drive, handles easily, and is pretty comfortable.\n",
      "The AC/Heat Fan speed control buttons are too small, somewhat buried, not easily accessible or intuitive located.\n",
      "Be cautious of he gas prices.\n",
      "The car is pretty heavy and has a bit more horsepower than your regular day to day car, so it uses more gas.\n",
      "The car is extremely fun to drive and is very reliable and safe!\n",
      "My ten year old Lexus is much easier to use and it has  the same technology (except for the blind spot warning) that is in the Q3!\n",
      "Fuel use is higher than average.\n",
      "Seats comfortable and ride in vehicle is smooth.\n",
      "Bluetooth not easy to use.\n",

      "The shiny metal shift handle gets very hot in the sun, so had to purchase of cover for it.\n",

      "It's so fun to drive and gets great gas mileage.\n",
      "The interior is beautiful, I have the light tan interior and blue exterior, great combination.\n",
      "Back seat leg room is very comfortable, as reported by my long legged daughter and over 6' cousin-in-law.\n",
      "A couple of things that I see that could be improved is the center console storage space and the small cup holders in the back seat.\n",

      "Love this car overall, absolutely love the way it drives, the comfort of the front seats, the quietness and the ride.\n",
      "Ditto the plastic cap over the left front seat rail (this has now broken in half but still snaps onto the rail so I keep knocking only the outer piece off now when I get out of the car).\n",
      "One complaint is that the Apple CarPlay system gets a little funny if you unplug or switch phones while driving (which my kids do all the time).\n",
      "You often have to reset the audio system so that the car accepts the external audio from the phone.\n",
      "While it has a comfortable ride, it lacks some safety features less expensive yet equally luxurious-  have.\n",
      "I still cannot believe that my almost $750 lease is for a car does that not have keyless entry or blind spot mirrors (if I compare it with a Kia I will get depressed!!).\n",
      "I wish you would change my car for one that has keyless and blind spot systems.\n",
      "May 20, 2016What I hate the most about the Q7 is that in a car that is technically luxurious, certain features should be standard (and not plus), such keyless entry and blind spot sensors.\n",
      "It leaks water into the passenger compartment, the electronics are constantly failing or doing weird things, and the navigation system is the worst I have ever used!\n",
      "Vehicle electronics will suddenly fail and reboot while driving!\n",
      "Oct 31, 2016For a luxury car, this car has features that simply do not compare with the quality of my 2011 Lincoln MKC.\n",
      "It drives beautifully, but other features seem to have been shortcut (i.e., the way the third row seats fold, the lack of touchscreen navigation, no adjustable pedals for height-challenged people, etc.\n",
      "The Q7 with the Prestige Package and adaptive chassis/4-wheel steering is a delight to drive.\n",
      "It is extremely comfortable, agile, and provides decent fuel economy if driven gently.\n",
      "Front seat storage area should be improved.\n",
      "We didn't have to order the Vision package to get the in-dash GPS map display, Etc.\n",
      "The lighted area is too narrow and is borderline dangerous when we driving around curvy and hilly areas at night.\n",
      "The best thing about my 2017 Audi Q7 is the steering.\n",
      "Purists might say that they want feedback from their steering, implying that it should be harder to steer, especially when going faster.\n",
      "But in both cases the mid-range audio is somehow enhanced in a way that shapes the audio quality negatively, and there is little I can do to mitigate it.\n",
      "It's a strange thing but somehow the front seats seem a little small.\n",
      "Maybe the surface area of the seat feels just slightly inadequate.\n",
      "My last car was a BMW 5 series with a special seat option.\n",
      "That seat had an adjustable extension for the legs and you felt thoroughly embraced.\n",
      "The 2017 Audi Q7 is a solid, fun to drive SUV with the correct amount of \"Driver Assist\" features; adaptive cruise control and lane keeping functions that do not drive the car for you, but provide a comforting sense of security by watching for lane drift or slow-down in front of you.\n",
      "I love the \"heads-up\" display that carries info on speed, speed-limit, navigation, and driver-assist functions active.\n",
      "The adaptive cruise and lane assist are phenomenal!\n",
      "No place to store the luggage shade inside the car when 3rd row seats are in use.\n",
      "Outside rear view mirrors too small and angular- not effective for this large a vehicle.\n",
      "Transmission shifter no longer P R N D L  format.This format is quirky, not tech.\n",
      "no longer a spare tire but less storage than previous model.\n",
      "No engine upgrade for more power .Only 1 option.\n",
      "My Audi is well engineered and offers a very comfortable drive, responsive handling, quick acceleration and a great dashboard/user interface that allows me to access my phone, various music sources and messages.\n",
      "It had better live up to my expectations over a number of years on performance and reliability.\n",
      "It doesn't attract eyes like our Mercedes ML but is very comfortable, very responsive and well engineered.\n",
      "Driving dynamics and interior design are much improved from the previous version, although several aspects of the vehicle are worse (infotainment system and driver interface, steering, size and loading capacity, exterior styling).\n",
      "Exterior styling is lackluster, but the interior design is outstanding.\n",
      "However, there is less than stellar pedal response at low speedsÃ¢ÂÂa depression of the accelerator at low speeds will not often result in immediate throttle response, but rather it feels as though the car is trying to anticipate my intent.\n",
      "This results in a rough ride at lower speeds as the car wants to either accelerate or slow to a stop, but doesn't like being driven at parking lot speeds.\n",
      "I really like technology when it's useful or makes things easier, but some features on this car make things more difficult and seem to just be added for the sake of adding them.\n",
      "All of the promotional materials showed the multi-colored ambient lighting, but never said that only came in the Prestige model, so it was disappointing to not have that in mine.\n",
      "An excellent work of craftsmanship and very luxurious interiors.\n",
      "Automatic foot pedals.\n",
      "During night time, there is a glare of interior lighting in the side view mirrors and also windshield.\n",
      "Quality of interior materials falls short of my A8, both of which are prestige level trim.\n",
      "It doesn't seem to have the power or shift as smoothly as my A8, even though it has the same engine/trans.\n",
      "It sounds like a small thing, but there have been numerous times that I have regretted it  It seems that, with all the luxury features, this would just be standard on a vehicle of this quality.\n",
      "Vehicle was delivered with damaged/defect door trims and damaged leather seat.\n",
      "The leather of the seats has different patterns and dye shades.\n",
      "Seats are rather uncomfortable-could use more side support (is almost non-existent)\n",
      "1) Having to hold down the button for the custom seat setting (should just touch and go).\n",
      "Similarly, the seat should retract when exiting the vehicle for better entry/exit (My 2007 Nissan Maxima had that).\n",
      "2) The blind spot sensor seems to miss sometimes.\n",
      "7) Third row seating for kids can be improved.\n",
      "Spend the extra money to purchase the virtual cockpit display.\n",
      "Oct 17, 2016Items for improvement: 1) The steering column should retract when the car is turned off to allow easier exit.\n",
      "Synchronization capability of temperature control system and access to the third row could be much better (including making lifting the middle seats easier).\n",
      "With the three-zone heating system, the vehicle does not have the capability to control the rear/second-row temperature zone by the driver as it does on previous Q7 models.\n",
      "Regarding features of the car, I had hoped that there was a number pad that could be used to dial phone numbers as I had in my previous car, and the cupholders seem to be very small in this car.\n",
      "Sometimes it says it is connected and I can actually work the Apple CarPlay through the car, but my then the music plays from my phone..?\n",
      "But the biggest issue is the electrical issue with my back door hatch.\n",
      "The sensor in my dash keeps showing it opened...but it is not.\n",
      "1- The sensors on the doors need to be tested more since they get lost if you're going in or out of the vehicle(lock and unlock).\n",
      "5- The cap on the front seat adjustment line is too cheap.\n",
      "The plastic cover on the front edge of the front seat rails is easily kicked and removed as one enters and exits the vehicle--this is one design area that needs to be improved upon.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016Any vehicle of this quality and cost should have a digital readout on the tire pressure rather than the necessity of the owner manually checking the pressure each month.\n",
      "I have a high frequency hearing loss from being around, guns, tanks, Howitzers, and helicopters for 30 years, so the questions on upgrading the sound system should really be discounted.\n",
      "I feel for the price paid they should include automatic braking as standard.\n",
      "Other manufacturers are selling less expensive cars with all features included.\n",
      "Interior looks cheap compared to other luxury cars.\n",
      "When on muddy roads, the mud flaps do not protect the doors from being caked in mud on the interior bottom portion  (all along the bottom seal).\n",
      "There should be a sealing mechanism to keep the mud from going inside the door.\n",
      "Nice, comfortable, fun to drive, looks good, very advanced technology, looks expensive, roomy, high-quality interior, heated and cooled seats are great, heated steering wheel is nice.\n",
      "I love all the safety/technology features.\n",
      "And it gives me enough cargo space that I feel I didn't compromise that feature instead of buying a Suburban.\n",
      "The ride quality is too stiff on rough roads, and the air conditioner fan noise is too loud.\n",
      "It is a joy to drive, loaded with safety features, well mannered, and all around visibility is good.\n",
      "The fit and finish, ride quality, performance and technological innovations in this Audi are extraordinary.\n",
      "I am absolutely thrilled with its performance, build quality, and luxury.\n",
      "Be sure to order all safe driving options (i.e., blind spot indicators, etc.).\n",
      "That the storage room space in the back is less than the former model and the back seats are hard to move to allow you in the third row.\n",
      "The redesigned console between the driver and passenger took up valuable seat room and comfort.\n",
      "Previous seats were more comfortable.\n",
      "The vehicle is unique, easy to drive, and has trend setting features.\n",
      "I wish that my vehicle came with touch door unlock features and space for a spare tire.\n",
      "Window controls way too hot because of metal trim on buttons.\n",
      "I would love to pay a la cart for options I want such as lane departure warning and autonomous braking.\n",
      "Small glare on the heads up display when sun is behind the vehicle.\n",
      "The turn signal noise is too loud and annoying, and so is the seat belt fastening noise.\n",
      "The only negative I have is the buffering noise on the interior when the front windows are down.\n",
      "Need to add wireless charging for cell phones, eyeglass holder and large cup holders.\n",
      "I absolutely love everything about the car--performance, technology, look, etc.\n",
      "Would have liked a larger console, cruise controls on the steering wheel, fog lights.\n",
      "Need to have seat lower for ease of entry and then return to driving position.\n",
      "Size, Power and Luxury.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016I'm am very pleased with my purchase of my Audi Q7, it was the right decision for my family & pets, and it makes me feel very safe when I drive.\n",
      "Audi seems to have a very high-quality and safe automobile and am pleased with every aspect of use of the Q7.\n",
      "I've had four Audis, and the engineering and style are beyond my expectations.\n",
      "The technology is like no other, it is a very smooth comfortable drive.\n",
      "Handles like a dream and I feel very safe.\n",
      "Superior styling, great drivability but should have optional larger engine.\n",
      "Top notch interior and styling but needs more center console storage.\n",
      "Don't do it.\n",
      "The sound when I start the engine makes me smile, and that smile continues through every drive in my RS3.\n",
      "A beautiful interior combined with aggressive exterior styling makes a great combination.\n",
      "A simple software tune from reputable manufacturers like APR or Unitronic can serve as a testament to how capable your engineering is and attract fanatical loyalty in the process if you support it.\n",
      "The car is a fantastic example of your brand, both styling and engineering.\n",
      "Only major problem is that car came with 21\" wheels.\n",
      "My previous Panamera used all-weather tires so I could use it in the snow.\n",
      "I can find no all-weather tires to fit these 21\" wheels.\n",
      "I was looking for maximum performance capability, and the RS 7 met my expectations in the context of the latter as well as expansive cargo space and superb technology.\n",
      "It is a fun car to drive and very sporty in sport mode, but also tame enough to be comfortable to drive and ride in when not pushed.\n",
      "Love: Performance, comfort, styling.\n",
      "Grumbles: Radio turns on every time car starts, ride is very stiff, navigation fails to detect traffic jams.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016What I LOVE:\r\n",
      "*** Taking off from a standing start with Launch ControlÃ¢ÂÂI still remember the rush the first time I used this and kept the throttle nailed through 1st and 2nd, only to stop at the next set of lights with six cops glaring at me from the sidewalk!\n",
      "*** The sound of the exhaust with the deleted resonator optionÃ¢ÂÂespecially the F1 burp on changing up under hard acceleration and the throttle blips on changing down.\n",
      "*** The paddle shift, especially how you can use it temporarily and it will fall back to autoÃ¢ÂÂthis is awesome for US freeways because you can tap it down a few gears and floor it for unexpected lane changes and off-ramps.\n",
      "*** The keyless operation of the vehicle, especially the unlock and lock mechanisms of the front doors and boot.\n",
      "*** The interior is a thing of beauty and elegant functionÃ¢ÂÂI have never driven a more luxurious and comfortable car that has this level of handling and performance.\n",
      "*** Never had a car with parking sensors or rearview camera before, but after driving my S3, I will never be without this feature ever again!\n",
      ":-)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I would change:\r\n",
      "*** Sometimes loses power on take-off for 1-2 seconds, and I'm scared I will be rear-endedÃ¢ÂÂalmost as if the electronics gets confused and does the wrong thing.\n",
      "*** The radio turns on automatically when the car starts, and I have to mute itÃ¢ÂÂI would like to be able to turn it off.\n",
      "*** I stopped using the navigation after it dropped me in the middle of bad traffic several times and would like to be able to used Google Maps through the Bluetooth\r\n",
      "*** The paddle shift should ignore my input if the transmission automatically changes at the same time I click the paddleÃ¢ÂÂcurrent behavior is to change two gears instead of one, which never ends well.\n",
      "The interior is elegantly restrained and ergonomic, seats are exceptionally comfortable.\n",
      "AWD is a must in snowy regions, and I am a huge fan of the Stop-and-Go Adaptive Cruise Control in rush hour traffic.\n",
      "THE GREATEST ANNOYANCE IS NOT BEING ABLE TO USE SIRI OR VOICE CONTROLS TO MY PHONE (Like adding calendar entries or reminders) WHEN IN THE CAR.\n",
      "Apr 8, 2016My Audi S3 is powerful, exhilarating to drive, has great technology and is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, in and out.\n",
      "Feb 4, 2016The Audi S3 is, to me, the ideal combination of exhilarating performance, great AWD handling, build quality, comfort, sporty appearance, compact size, ergonomics, and beautiful, restrained interior styling.\n",
      "The ride (even without Magnetic Ride) is firm, but not at all harsh, and the suspension isolates road noise very well.\n",
      "I am very pleased with the MMI, which I find mostly intuitive, and I applaud Audi for resisting the move to touchscreens, which I have experienced as dangerously distracting since you have to take your hands and eyes off the wheel.\n",
      "(B) You can't easily control streaming music services like Spotify through MMI (e.g., you can only see or change playlists through the phone).\n",
      "During this short time frame, I've had multiple issues with the vehicle sound system not wanting to produce sound in any form (i.e., nav, music, phone, etc.).\n",
      "Having to completely kill the power to the car and restarting is the most efficient way and it's not fun.\n",
      "I've also encountered a lot of road noise with the tires and interior during my daily commutes that I did not have in my previous 2006 Audi S4.\n",
      "I'm also getting a lot of rattling in the front doors in the middle like the same piece on each door is loose?\n",
      "Would be nice to have a full size rim/tire set for a luxury vehicle.\n",
      "Using faster electronic systems should be a priority.\n",
      "I regret accepting the MMI option, since except for the rear backup, doesn't seem to offer me concrete benefits, since the Sirius XM navigation is so cumbersome and inferior to the Google Maps capability on my smartphone.\n",
      "Audi should help with eliminating the requirement for ethanol mixed gasoline in California, since this impairs car gas milage and probably performance as well.\n",
      "The S3 is exhilarating to drive, responsive, powerful, quick, with an emotive exhaust note, and is great looking.\n",
      "Apr 8, 2016Following would be desireable:\r\n",
      "Better boost gauge \r\n",
      "Coolant temp data \r\n",
      "Analog fuel gauge \r\n",
      "Slightly lower ride height \r\n",
      "MORE HORSEPOWER!\n",
      "A combination of new and familiar, having some interior instrument features similar to the VW GTI.\n",
      "Steering feel is important, and this is where Audi continues to be weak compared to other brands.\n",
      "There is a lack of connection to the from tires in the S3 and it's disappointing for a sports oriented model.\n",
      "Mar 21, 2016Interior squeaks and rattles conveys sense of a cheap product.\n",
      "Engine note sounds like a diesel engine at times.\n",
      "Engine performance not up to par with car at this price point.\n",
      "Fuel economy is much lower than indicated unreal driving conditions.\n",
      "Feb 12, 2016The car is ok, but not quite living up to expectations for gas mileage and suspension performance.\n",
      "I almost should have waited for the 2017 model to get Android Auto.\n",
      "The voice commands and MMI might be awesome compared to other manufacturer's systems, but compared to my phone and Android Auto, they are pretty mediocre.\n",
      "Perhaps I've been spoiled by the use of my Android phone and Google, but it destroys the voice recognition and navigation in my 2016 car.\n",
      "My car would be nearly perfect if it either included Android Auto or was upgradeable to include it.\n",
      "Great car, my only issue is that the rear parcel shelf rattles from the subwoofer with the B&O sound system.\n",
      "I wanted AWD, four doors and a manual in this purchase but settled for an automatic.\n",
      "After the purchase I had questions about how to use features of the vehicle and some didn't work while for others I was told (after my purchase) that those features were not available for my model of vehicle.\n",
      "One of the few missing features that I really wish the S3 had: When displaying the list of Sirius stations, the screen should show the song currently playing on that station in the list.\n",
      "It would be much better if I could scroll through the list of channels and see, at a glance, the song playing on each channel.\n",
      "More sound from the exhaust system while in dynamic mode would add to the overall experience of driving the vehicle for fun.\n",
      "Quality, performance, comfort, reliability, Quattro,.\n",
      "Size and power lead to come compromises in storage, comfort, fuel economy but that is the price you pay for the aforementioned size and power and these compromises were more the worth it.\n",
      "Same with driver-size seat memory for power seats.\n",
      "I love everything about he car, but at 53k and with sports seats you loose power seats.\n",
      "Would love to have power memory seats since I'm paying over 50k.\n",
      "It handles beautifully and gets pretty good gas mileage for the power (29 mpg).\n",
      "Apr 17, 2016Would like to have pre-sets for the driver's seat for multiple drivers\r\n",
      "would like to have heated steering wheel.\n",
      "Fun, sporty small car with enough room in back seat for carpool.\n",
      "Apr 30, 2018Everything is great except the sunroof rattles and need to take it in for service.\n",
      "The A3 could have a little more room in the front seats.\n",
      "It's a wonderful blend of performance, economy, comfort, and technology.\n",
      "An excellent combination of high performance and comfort.\n",
      "No power seats.\n",
      "pretty poor gas mileage but fun to drive, luxurious, fairly reliable, safe certain hoses are susceptible to mouse damage, certain oils/lubricants?\n",
      "Electric is extremely important to me, just love Audi and do not like look or performance of current hybrid or electric.\n",
      "Please offer cloth seat option for vegetarians!\n",
      "They are summer performance tires.\n",
      "This car is perfect except, I really wish it had a system exactly like Mercedes Embrace or BMW's connected drive phone app.\n",
      "The single CD player located in the glove compartment could pose a safety problem if driving alone and want to play or change CDs.\n",
      "The only other comment is that their could be more storage space in the front seat area for misc items.\n",
      "Next step is integrating with phones better (a la Tesla) so it can be used to start A/C on a hot day, lock/unlock doors, or even start car remotely, Jun 29, 2017Got everything I wanted.\n",
      "Add electric power for better off the line performance such as electric-powered turbos or hybrid engines.\n",
      "Ensure that you look at the stock tire/wheel size vs optional wheel sizes - the default option looks a bit 'small'.\n",
      "Good value luxury sports car!\n",
      "Quality vehicle...A beautiful piece of engineering.\n",
      "Performance, luxury, good looks and a great sound.\n",
      "I want my phone to log into MMI after using the password once, not every time.\n",
      "For the first 1500 miles the transmission would take too long to engage after coming off the brake from a stop to accelerating away.\n",
      "I like using Google maps for navigation.\n",
      "Although the car uses Google maps for navigation, it is a different interface.\n",
      "Voice recognition is poor enough for me not to use it.\n",
      "The only disappoint I have is that you cannot get an interior option that is full color specific like the A8/S8.\n",
      "I love the Arras Red Audi Design package in my S6, but I really wish I could have had an option to get brown that included the dash being the same color, not black, but Audi does not offer a leather-wrapped dash and doors in the C7 chassis (A/S/RS6/7).\n",
      "Moving on from high performance Porsche and roadster Mercedes to a luxury sedan.\n",
      "Do not regret the purchase, impressed with performance, handling, luxury and technology features.\n",
      "Extremely disappointed that trunk cargo net and safety/warning triangle were not included in the $85000 MSRP price, yet I was charged $120 for cell phone cables that are available most anywhere for less than $40.\n",
      "I do wish that every time vehicle is started that the radio or media comes on.\n",
      "The car is perfect - power, handling, fun to drive, comfort, safety, anything one might want in a car is there for you.\n",
      "Better wheel choices.\n",
      "You really need a performance based electric car and/or plug in hybrid in your lineup.\n",
      "Performance, comfort, etc all great.\n",
      "Vehicle exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, quality and comfort.\n",
      "Car is reliable, drives exceptionally well, smooth, quiet, and has the power to perform.\n",
      "And to have a performance vehicle that is also luxurious.\n",
      "I drove from dealer to dealer to see wha the actual colors were for both interior and exterior.\n",
      "YOU CAN ONLY FIT ONE CUP AT A TIME IN FRONT SEAT AREA.\n",
      "It's a nice car, but has serious issues with tire and brake wear, and both are NOT cheap.\n",
      "I am really impressed with the overall high quality of engineering.\n",
      "I love the car and have a lot of fun driving it, but I miss a couple details that I was expecting on a sports car like a more aggressive engine sound or at least the option to switch between the muffled smooth engine sound and the more aggressive one.\n",
      "Aug 15, 2016I wish the car had an exhaust control valve, it would improve the \"sporty\" feeling of the car by being able to open and get a better engine noise/sound.\n",
      "I was looking for a vehicle that had the best combination of features and performance for the price.\n",
      "I went with the Audi because of the price for features and performance.\n",
      "There should be more options for the wheels in size and design.\n",
      "The only thing I wish I had was better options for the wheels and tires from the factory.\n",
      "Technology and performance are as expected.\n",
      "The 2016 TTS had everything I was looking for with features and performance.\n",
      "This said, I wish Audi provided more choices in colors, especially the interior options.\n",
      "I was only able to get high performance summer tires on this car.\n",
      "I had to change them to high-performance all season tires (it snows a LOT where I live).\n",
      "Go for the extra horsepower and high-profile tires.\n",
      "I would add a few things: sunglasses storage in headliner, adaptive cruise control, auto rain sensor wipers, an adjustable armrest that doesn't conflict with the one cupholder, seat memory setting, sunroof or glass roof.\n",
      "Beautiful car, great quality, and drives great.\n",
      "Love the inside look of my car, the red interior and nano gray metallic exterior looks awesome.\n",
      "The 2016 TTS that I currently drive has state of the art technology and is extremely well engineered.\n",
      "Only negative is the Bluetooth sound quality.\n",
      "The hatch back should lift and close on its own and you should offer auto parallel parkingÃ¢ÂÂvery difficult to know where the edge of the vehicle due to its rounded shape.\n",
      "The headlights and interior noise are an issue.\n",
      "The BMW M235 uses Active Sound Design ASD to deliver artificial exhaust sound through the audio speakers.\n",
      "The engine sound is  great and the added fake amplified sound coming from the speakers ruins the benefit of a premium audio system and is completely unnecessary and annoying.\n",
      "BMW headlights are of high quality but the factory aim is terrible and even though BMW headlights were named \"worst in the industry\" because of the aim issue BMW are not happy to change the settings at this time August 2016.\n",
      "If I were 18 years old I would love the extra volume but my M235 engine and exhaust sound is wonderful without the need for amplified fake sounds added to my audio system speakers ruining my premium audio.\n",
      "Younger buyers may be accustom to low quality compressed digital music but if you offer premium sound at least allow those who paid for the upgrade to enjoy that premium sound.\n",
      "The lighting technology used by BMW is some of the best but the factory aiming is too low.\n",
      "Mar 21, 2016I purchased the premium sound system but BMW use something called Active Sound Design ASD that sends artificial exhaust sound through the premium speakers.\n",
      "The engine of my M235 sounds great without this artificial intrusion on the sound system.\n",
      "And I say this because 1) other vehicles at or even below this price point have the features, even though critical performance attributes one pays for with BMW are missing from those vehicles and 2) I expect more from BMW, and for this price point.\n",
      "Plus, where the speakers are placed in the doors needs work.\n",

      "Further, I can never find the correct seating position because the seat base does not tilt far enough up in the front.\n",
      "Another feature that we are extremely disappointed in is the 270-degree camera on the car.\n",
      "For a near $60,000 car, it is inexcusable to not offer 360-degree camera capability, as this feature has been available on other brands, and on much cheaper cars, for a relatively long time (our friends' 2008 Infiniti EX35, for example, has a far superior around-car camera system than our 2017 BMW 330i).\n",

      "I ordered and received the Cognac Leather interior in my 430Xi GC... but---unlike my previous 328Xi in which the interior Venetian Beige color was carried throughout the ENTIRE interior (except for the top of the dashboard (with which I totally agree) and the steering wheel/column)---the only Cognac colored parts of my 430 are the seats, the center console, and the door panels... everything else is BLACK, including the headliner.\n",
      "I'd much prefer more of the Cognac coloring in other parts of the interior.\n",
      "The Adaptive Cruise Control's radar sensors embrace too wide an angle for my tastes, as a driver.\n",
      "Once a preceding vehicle has left my lane for an adjacent lane, the cruise control should assume my previously set speed... not wait 2 seconds, and even brake, before doing so...\n",
      "I doubt that I'll purchase my next BMW with Sport Seats.\n",
      "Everything about them is great, EXCEPT the seat bottom bolsters.\n",
      "I'm a relatively big guy, and the non-adjustable seat bottom bolsters dig into my thighs, which causes pain after about 15 minutes... not at all conducive to long trips.\n",
      "I've had to place a foam pad in the seat bottom to raise sitting position sufficiently so those bolsters do not dig into my thighs.\n",
      "Although the entertainment system interface in my 430 is better than that of my previous 328, it is still far from being reliable.\n",
      "I have an Apple iPhone, and when playing my own music, the interface controls when using the BMW entertainment system simply fail to function, or sometimes only funtion partially.\n",
      "Interface with Apple Car Play is more reliable, but doesn't have nearly as much flexiblility as does BMW's interface, when working properly.\n",
      "Was very disappointed that Seat Cooling was not an available option for the 4 Series vehicles... not available in anything short of the 6 and 7 Series BMWs.\n",
      "Seat Cooling is available in many models of Acura, Lexus, Infinity below their 'flagship' models.\n",
      "Such an option is indeed a desirable (and sellable) convenience to those of us who live and drive in the Southern tier of the United States... even for 3, 4 and 5 Series BMWs.\n",
      "Great power and handling and fun to drive.\n",
      "Lots of internal noise, goofy German features (i.e.\n",
      "heat/cool controls, menus for setup, no panic handles, no scoop handles in doors) bad bad navigation system and map features, traffic data is terrible.\n",
      "The \"auto\" function does nothing for temperature control and the vents are really narrow and restricting to the airflow.\n",
      "The doors need scoop handles or the existing handless should be much farther back.\n",
      "Aug 15, 2016The Engine-Shut-Off feature in Econo-Pro mode is annoying.\n",
      "The doors are missing \"cup style\" door handles to assists with opening or closing the doors from inside the car.\n",
      "The storage console between the seats is a joke.\n",
      "I've reported this before, that useful interior features from recent years of the same model (2012 328i coupe) like folding/expanding door pockets, and grab handles over the door, and a dashboard slot to insert the key fob, and a simple intuitive gear selector, are eliminated -- the new 'joystick' is stupid -- you push forward to go backward/reverse?\n",
      "-- you should have a traditional gear selector, or a joystick where pull backward to back up and push forward to go forward -- whatever; I know the foregoing request is hopeless, but why did BMW eliminate the dashboard slot for the key fob?\n",
      "While acceleration is great, there is few second hesitation when I need to take off quickly in comfort mode.\n",
      "I am determined to get used to this to add to my fuel efficiency.\n",
      "The control panel, depending on the position of the steering wheel, is difficult to see.\n",
      "The driver's seat overall is not very comfortable.\n",
      "Also, the driver's seat does not lift high enough for me, making it difficult to see over the steering wheel.\n",
      "The black Dakota leather with red stitching gives the interior a sporty but refined quality.\n",
      "It's worth the upgrade if you enjoy quality sound.\n",
      "wonderful vehicle to drive-  smooth and comfortable, beautiful and cares just melt away with the top down.\n",
      "If I had to do it again I would get the 435 instead of the 428 for the larger engine, primarily because I had that engine before and miss the power.\n",
      "Absolutely hate the feel of electronic steering and the electric gear shifter.\n",
      "I do not care for the electronic steering.\n",
      "Also, the engine noise and pickup are not as satisfying as my previous car, a 335xi.\n",
      "The engine sounds like it's working much too hard, especially when accelerating or going uphill.\n",
      "The vehicle parking sensor should come on when the car goes below 5mph - not just when backing up.\n",
      "The lack of a night vision mode on the backup camera is disappointing.\n",
      "The camera is great during the day, but at night when backing into a dark spot is very difficult to see.\n",
      "Mar 3, 2016The proximity sensor should automatically come on when you are under a certain speed - say 5mph.\n",
      "The backup camera at night leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "Other than that - I am very happy with the car, the comfort, the ride, the performance, etc.\n",
      "This is a fun yet sophisticated sporty hard top convertible with a lot of power available with limited to no turbo lag and all wheel drive for when the weather does not cooperate.\n",
      "You asked about tires but had no space to comment - our last car was the BMW 335i convertible with low profile tires - we had to replace all of the rims before selling the car - great that the vehicle had run flats but I don't miss having the low profile that makes hitting any bump make you wince wondering if you just hurt your rims.\n",
      "There are some things that I am disappointed in - it had no rear camera so had to have a third party install and it is in an odd place and seems to affect auto unlocking of my trunk, button to unlock passenger door is not in an effective place (have to get in the car to unlock to door, leaving passenger standing outside), lots of problems with voice commands for navigation (frequently changes radio channel instead), the \"mouse\" is in a bad spot (by the arm rest) - my dog stepped on it and reset display and I can't get the weather forecast to display again.\n",
      "A passenger accidentally put their elbow on the mouse since it's in the area of an arm rest and changed my radio station.\n",
      "Also, the interior door handle to pull the door closed, not the actual door opening handle, is too far back, it isn't a natural feel to pull the door shut.\n",
      "When you have the seat and mirrors set for Driver 1 or 2 you should not have to hold down the \"1\" button to have it restored.\n",
      "Hard to use Pandora and outside apps ie Spotify with BMW bluetooth system\r\n",
      "4.\n",

      "6.\n",

      "I very much like having a button \r\n",
      "to close the trunk.\n",
      "The electric steering has improved but still needs to have more road feel.\n",
      "I would like to be able to set the steering on sport but leave the suspension on comfort.\n",
      "Also can the design \r\n",
      "of the side mirrors be done in such a way that water drains out instead of running down the doors \r\n",

      "doors when I first drive the car after washing.\n",
      "I wish you would put the passenger door/trunk unlocking button on the driver door armrest.\n",
      "The trunk unlock button is in an inconvenient location.\n",
      "I don't carry my keys in my pocket like a guy and my purse is generally on the front seat of the car as I unload the car.\n",
      "I like the phone charger in the console and changing the location of the cup holders is an improvement as well as moving the navigation screen higher.\n",
      "I would have preferred an option to upgrade the leather interrior and very much would have preferred an option for ventilated seats as well........otherwise i love my car.\n",
      "make an option to upgrade the leather and allow for ventilated seats !!!\n",
      "Mar 23, 2016wish we had the option for higher grade leather seats, ability to remotely turn on FULL heat or AC to pre-warm or cool car and ventilated seats to go with the heated seats would have been nicer to have ........a lot of cars, which cost less have that capability  as either standard equipment or option.\n",
      "3) The sun visors are embarrassingly cheap and lack extenders, which limits functionality.\n",
      "4) The seats retain body heat and get quite hot and sweaty, wish for perforated seats as an option (not available until the 5-series), which is available on several other down-market vehicles from other manufacturers.\n",
      "This has impact on egress and utility (no where to hang anything over the back seat).\n",
      "I have always relied and trusted on your reputed brand for my safety and driving.\n",

      "Nov 18, 2016Front seats hard to get in & out of without scraping on the outer side edge of the leather seats.\n",
      "There is practically no storage room in the armrest console, I think due to the wireless phone charging.\n",
      "Front seats sit low and may not be appropriate for shorter heights.\n",

      "* I expected a smoother ride\r\n",
      "* I expected less road noise.\n",
      "I am leasing a vehicle that cost over $70k after upgrades and to have the level of road noise from run-flat tires, which make this luxury and sporty vehicle sound like a LOWER-GRADE SUV, is excruciatingly disappointing.\n",
      "The run-flat tires and the lack of a satisfactory response from BMW give me room to pause when my lease expires.\n",
      "It was a pleasure!\n",
      "Inspect tires closely before driving from lot since if you don't buy separate tire/wheel warranty, and there is a defect you may not be covered.\n",

      "It's exciting, powerful and fun to drive In comparison with a Porsche Cayenne, which we also own, the biggest advantages of the Porsche over my BMW Series 6 convertible are as follows:  it's much easier to initiate the cruise control and the warning lights (for a car in your blind spot) on the outside rear view mirrors are much larger and brighter than the BMW\n",
      "Great vehicle with exceptional handling and beautiful interior and exterior details.\n",

      "The 760 has a split personality; hit the sport button, the exhaust opens up and it runs/handles as well as my M6 grand coupe.\n",
      "The space saver spare is also worthless as it only allows you to drive up to 50mph, which is dangerously slow on most highways.\n",

      "Wonderful car, the only problem is the bluetooth audio system, it just does not work well, unacceptable for a car at any price point let alone $100k.\n",

      "Oct 21, 2016PLEASE, PLEASE give me a way to go back and forth between tracks on my external device by using a button on the steering wheel, like my X5 diesel has!!\n",
      "The powertrain, exterior, and interior design are daringly futuristic, but the car exhibits tight handling, a good upright seating position, communicative road feel, and heavy steering that remind me of classic BMWs like the e28 and e30 much more than any other new BMW I've driven.\n",
      "Aug 2, 2016I enjoy the interior, but it could use improvement in a few small areas.\n",
      "But to claim significant share they need to exceed the range of Tesla going forward at a lower price then they are charging today for their under sized i3.\n",

      "The windows roll down to half way by them selves after the car is locked and then unlock the doors...it cannot be trusted.\n",
      "May 25, 2016i find it hard to think that BMW would build a auto without a CD player in it or the ability to use one.\n",
      "I have now owned two i3's, both with back up engine and the current bring the s version and would immediately trade up to the next battery with a realistic driving range up to 300 miles\n",
      "For enhanced performance in general (and eco-friendliness), I encourage offering lighter-weight versions of typically standard optionsÃ¢ÂÂnot everything needs to be power-assisted.\n",
      "The i3 seats are a good exampleÃ¢ÂÂnicely engineered!\n",
      "My next car will be a BEV crossover with AWD (one of Tesla Model Y, ix3, Jaguar iPace, Mercedes EQC, or a used BMW i3 or new/used Tesla Model 3 AWD if none of those are in my price point with the features I require)\n",
      "The driver's seat is extremely comfortable and I feel that BMW thought of everything in terms of comfort and convenience when creating this car.\n",
      "The car is very smooth when driving since there are no gears and I love that it makes virtually no noise.\n",
      "Two things I would suggest should be standard are: (1) Motorized driver seat adjustments.\n",
      "The manual movement of the seats reminds me of my first Honda...Most luxury cars don't have manual seat adjustments.\n",
      "(2) Memory for seat position.\n",
      "It would then adjust based on the key so that if dad is driving vs. mom is driving, the seats would adjust automatically.\n",
      "The i3 handling and that feeling of being connected to the road through the steering wheel reminds me a bit of the older generation BMW's which is a good thing.\n",

      "I would never go back to a gas powered vehicle.\n",
      "Sep 23, 2016Lack of a functioning Android app and the requirement to connect a smartphone to use additional apps (Pandora, Stitcher etc) is unacceptable in modern car.\n",
      "Definitely not suited for long road trips, even in REx form, as the gas tank is too small to be useful, but works well for the occasional mid-range road trip or when additional range is necessary in a pinch.\n",
      "The brake lights should come on sooner while coasting or regeneration braking.\n",
      "Should have a indicator the brake lights are on under these conditions.\n",

      "Love the heated seat, radio, back flips down, sub compact - fits is spaces and great view.\n",
      "Please give me my torque back - you dropped the low end power to save the engine mounts; I'd rather you put in beefier mounts.\n",
      "French door design works well most of the time but not so when park next to cars.\n",
      "It is somewhat difficult to get in and out of car with such door design.\n",
      "It is taking me awhile to get used to sporty driving due to the light steering feel and the quick torque.\n",
      "I wonder what is in the doors to address side impact protection.\n",
      "Give me the ability to control my phone from the steering wheel.\n",
      "Nov 19, 2016I love my i3 and just wish that it had a more powerful/longer running battery and a sunroof.\n",
      "No reverse camera is unacceptable with this technology and price point.\n",
      "I have the impression that the fabric used in the seats makes me sweat like crazy =(.\n",
      "Since the tail lights are only attached to the glass, the car could not be operated.\n",
      "But, I miss the sound of the engine; Miss sitting up high; loved the size...surprisingly enough, it matters.\n",
      "I was told it would have a back-up camera, and it didn't.\n",

      "Bright for headlights.\n",
      "The door handles for entry are not sensitive or responsive enough.\n",
      "The mechanism used to start car and change to drive or reverse is not responsive enough, once i click start and turn handke it should turn blue and enable change to drive or reverse mode, i have to jig it several times to enable it to change modes.\n",

      "Too much wind noise from window seams and joints.\n",
      "It is an engineering marvel and I am getting great gas mileage near 80 mpgs with my driving patterns.\n",
      "The entire gas-electric hybrid drive train in combination with outstanding styling (the doors are especially fantastic) is a testament to the strength of BMW engineering.\n",
      "Love the car but feel it could me more competitive ( acceleration wise) with the Tesla when considering the price point.\n",
      "They may not be hybrids but at that price point and considering how long I'll keep the car, who cares.\n",
      "Oct 22, 2016Needs the latest tech like lane assistant & auto pilot and more cabin storage.\n",
      "More customization of the instrument readouts would be  nice especially oil ,water, & battery temps oil & boost pressures\r\n",
      "The ability to Adjust The of regeneration brakes from I drive.\n",
      "I love the car but I wish they would put a scratch coating on the inside door panel.\n",
      "I8 owners want performance over gas mileage.\n",
      "The documentation for comfort/sport/sport+ modes is woefully inadequate for a vehicle with this performance capability.\n",
      "The owners manual is one of the worst I have ever seenÃ¢ÂÂget a native English speaker with knowledge of the functions to write for US customers and include separate manuals for the electronic systems with each carÃ¢ÂÂdon't make the customer have to ask the dealer for them.\n",
      "The car is a blast to drive and sounds great, but the amount of torque should allow a taller gear set in the manualÃ¢ÂÂfirst is essentially useless.\n",
      "This could later keep the value higher for someone looking for a particular color.\n",
      "The inside cabin materials should be higher quality than the plastic they use on the center console area and the lid on the center console between the front seats that opens moves/slides too easily if you move your arm on it as a rest.\n",
      "Jun 3, 2016Plastic on interior is cheap looking and not at a BMW standard or perception of the brand, and not much better than a Ford Focus.\n",
      "Performance and luxury is what I wanted and the status of working hard as a professional woman who loves driving and cars.\n",
      "Aug 3, 2016The issue described as a \"moderate\" problem and yet unresolved is the lighting of the instrument cluster in the M2 during daylight driving.\n",
      "At times I am completely unable to see the speedometer or tachometer due to lack of proper lighting and the color of the instrument cluster.\n",
      "Needs more colors (interior and exterior) and options available.\n",
      "BMW has got to get rid of the active sound design (fake engine noise).\n",
      "I understand the design motive to enter a lower price point than other M models, but: (1) No quantified temperature gauge???\n",

      "Dec 9, 2016There is an irregular but persistent noise coming from the wheel/brake area that is worrisome.\n",
      "What can I not use cruise in sport plus ?\n",
      "BMW should be embarrassed by how poorly engineered this feature is, and the whole concept that they assume I cannot make smooth downshifts is an insult to me.\n",
      "Good handling and power.\n",
      "Hate the fake engine noise.\n",
      "Jun 4, 2016Bought for the rear wheel drive, manual transmission, good power, somewhat light weight.\n",
      "Handling is excellent, styling is awesome, power is great even with the slight turbo lag.\n",
      "The only items I'd change are color options and the ability to have both climate zones controlled, either together or separate.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016Wish that there was a button to control both climate zones at the same time and not just individually.\n",
      "Nov 18, 2016Some things that would make the M2 perfect: M-style mirrors, 5-point seatbelt compatible seats, LED headlights and taillights, HUD, better brake pads.\n",
      "Sep 30, 2016Need better brake pads, like the ones used at M track day.\n",
      "Why would you remove the parking sensors from the front from the M235i and not put them on the M2, it makes NO SENSE AT ALL.\n",

      "Understand engine sound is piped in- you could nix that, the car sounds sweet all by itself.\n",
      "The sideview mirror turn signal flashers should be redesigned so they are not visible to the driver as this is distracting when changing lanes.\n",

      "Fog lamps, blind spot monitor, and an optional moonroof would be nice.\n",
      "This efficient dynamics gauge is not useful, especially on a M car.\n",
      "For performance models like the M3, an affordable CS-type vehicle with less sound deadening and less amenities (but without a huge mark-up and new expensive carbon fiber parts added to lose weight) would be highly attractive to me.\n",
      "The competition package was a step in the right direction - I wouldn't have bought the car if that hadn't been an option - but I would be much more inclined to buy or lease another M3 (and likely would have done so sooner) if there was a model that had the competition package and took away some of the unnecessary luxury features of even the standard car (like power seats, some of the speakers, etc.).\n",
      "Standard cars today are very nice and I find they have way more features than I want or need - for a sports/luxury vehicle, the M3 leans more to the \"luxury\" side than I would like, though I suppose most cars are these days.\n",
      "Sparing some standard amenities for a lighter weight car with a more visceral feel, without require any extra equipment or replacing parts with expensive carbon fiber, would get me very interested.\n",

      "BMW finally got cup holders right  :)  Overall, it's a great care.\n",

      "Braking at slow speeds/idle/stop light/heavy traffic is touchy and jerky.\n",
      "The buttons that control the display system can get stuck sometimes and feel \"cheap\" - specifically the plastic...I am referring to the radio, navigation, phone, etc rocker type switches in the center console.\n",
      "Don't get the 19\"wheels if you want to find snow tires that fit (have been trying for weeks).\n",
      "I wish the sales rep had warned me about lack of blind spot detection, the fact that tires are not all season, and the difficulty of getting snow tires for the car.\n",
      "The ride is very comfortable, it handles well, gas mileage is good, interior space and seat options are helpful adn added features work out well.\n",
      "One obnoxious issue is that when a cell phone or other things fall between the seat and console, they are very difficult to recover, especially when driving.\n",
      "Good power, very quiet, roomy, great features, good mileage.\n",

      "Would have preferred a slightly larger engine so the car would not sound so much like a tin can.\n",
      "Even though it is a smaller model, for someone who wants a car that is slightly higher off the ground but did not want the full on SUV like the X3 or X5, would have been able to get better seats and engine choices.\n",
      "I have two things that should be changed in the next model; \r\n",
      "-change the door jam so the rubber seal doesn't wipe your rear when you get in.\n",
      "-bring the gas pedal connection down from above so that floor mats don't interfere with the pedals function.\n",
      "Love the simplified shift system of the BMW X1 versus the other models where you have to press down a dinky little small  button in the middle of the shift knob and it's overly sensitive and not in any way desirable for our driving experience.\n",
      "Also, air conditioning to cargo area.\n",
      "This is an important safety feature, and one that has worked reliably on other vehicles for many years.\n",
      "Next the seats (front driver needs to go up higher.\n",

      "Front seats are very uncomfortable.\n",
      "The seat cushion is too short, and the back is too narrow.\n",
      "BMW has greatly improved the X1, i was afraid at first that the change to transverse engine (front wheel drive) platform from E90 platform would result in an inferior vehicle, but after driving the vehicle and discussing the new platform, I decided to lease an 2018 X1 when i had planned to buy the 2015 when the lease was up.\n",
      "My number one issue with the car is after finding the perfect setting for the seat concerning comfort, I cannot see all the electronic display information.\n",
      "This should not be an issue, but the lip on the electronic display panel blocks my view and it a serious issue and irritant.\n",

      "I also think safety cameras 360 around the car should be standard.\n",
      "1300 miles), and while the ride and performance was fantastic, it is unlikely that we will take it on long trips again...simply because the front seats are to narrow for me to sit in comfortably for a long drive (I'm 6'2\", 225lbs) and create a pressure point on either side of my backside.\n",
      "It's very comfortable and roomy for road trips.\n",
      "It holds lots of cargo with the seats down.\n",
      "The interior is lovely, but the exterior design is boring.\n",
      "The bluetooth functionality is not reliable.\n",

      "Additionally with the premium package that I have, a backup camera should be standard!\n",
      "Definitely get the upgraded safety features including collision alert and lane assist.\n",
      "The sport seats and sliding and reclining rear seats are also well worth the asking price.\n",
      "The only problem with this car is the fact that it is Front Wheel Drive, the steering wheel can tug at times when start from a stop and/or turning from a stop - possibly over-steering torque of some sort.\n",
      "The seatbelt connectors in the front seats are terrible.\n",
      "Items in door storage slide away, difficult to locate and remove.\n",
      "I love driving it and am not sorry that I bought it, but am still quite confused by some of the technology features, and the clock loses a minute per day.\n",

      "The vents barely blow any heat and are confusing.\n",
      "Just make a better sound system and seats more comfortable for people with bigger/wider rears.\n",
      "My only concern--it is difficult to fasten the seat belt because of the console.\n",

      "Need more powerful engine options.\n",
      "Safe vehicle with a good ride.\n",

      "If you are 5' or smaller the seats could adjust a little better.\n",

      "I would stress how reliable, safe and stylish my Beamers are.\n",
      "Great Handling and Technology implementation.\n",
      "Disappointed in the ease of entry/exit (no steering column auto-tilt) and rear seat room (ability to have a knee on outside of front seat is limited by door arm rest).\n",
      "The Build Your Own website is very poor and provides a poor example of the quality engineering BMW does on their vehicles.\n",
      "Many options are not adequately described For example, ordering a compact spare will reduce the usable cargo volume by raising the cargo bed vs just using the hole that is below the cargo bed.\n",
      "Yet picture used on website of the option shows a picture of the standard (lower) cargo area!!\n",
      "Marketing department also did a poor job of informing/explaining issues regarding sudden swap of M steering wheel with just a \"sport\" steering wheel.\n",
      "Options are very different in different regions of the world and unrelated features are often packaged in ways that don't make sense from a pure engineering sense.\n",
      "Many options came along with undesirable side effects (loss of cargo capacity when getting spare, loss of bolster adjustment when getting ventilated seats).\n",
      "Others, like the sudden unavailability in the US for the true M Sport steering wheel, have been poorly communicated and explained.\n",
      "The voice activated controls is a great safety feature and also convenient.\n",
      "My tires are nitro filled, yet I continue to have issues with weather temperature fluctuations.\n",
      "Another annoying issue, while driving and changing drive modes, I seem to accidentally change the odometer view.\n",
      "The buttons seem to be very sensitive and I accidentally open the trunk.\n",
      "Last annoying feature, while getting out of the car with my purse on my left arm, it sometimes moves the seat by hitting the automatic seat controls.\n",

      "Include a ventilated seat option.\n",

      "Also, have setting where steering column goes in and raises to let you out when door opens.\n",
      "The ONLY reason that we didn't buy a Tesla Model X instead of the BMWx4 is that we already own a Tesla, and thought it risky to own no gas-powered vehicles since the Tesla supercharger network has not been completed.\n",

      "Feb 3, 2016Very luxurious interior but missing simple items like handle above door, coin holder and controls not under steering column.\n",

      "I think for the price, the X4 should come with more standard features.\n",
      "Lane departure and other tech features are standard on Hondas.\n",

      "Continues to push for more fuel efficiency in comfort/eco mode (30 mpg) and don't worry about sport mode, I am willing to pay for the gas when I go mean red.\n",

      "I love just about everything about my new car except it is NOT that easy to enter the driver seat at the setting I require; some times the radio settings change and it takes me FOREVER to get it back where I want it because there are SO MANY OPTIONS/SETTINGS to work through to find the original setting.\n",

      "One of the first things I noticed was how solid the doors and fold down seats were compared to my older vehicle.\n",

      "Driving mostly in the northeast I was hesitant about the 20'' wheels since they are three season tires only.\n",

      "Consider getting a lower powered two wheel drive.\n",
      "The four wheel suspension on my 5.0 X6 xDrive is not up to the task.\n",
      "The ride height is perfect for easy entry and the fold-down rear seats allow greatly enhanced cargo capacity.\n",
      "Multiple driving modes turn the X6 from a highway cruiser into a race car at the touch of a button.\n",
      "The only suggestion I would make is to make the driver's seat retract to a position that eases entry when the vehicle is turned off.\n",
      "Regarding the blind spot monitoring system, the light that illuminates is yellow, and I think it should be red.\n",

      "Although it is a beautiful vehicle, we are quite dissatisfied with several aspects of its design and will most likely not purchase a Buick again unless these issues are addressed:\r\n",
      "Cannot use both the driver console armrest and the front seat cup holder... either/or.\n",
      "Door cup holders will only hold a CLOSED slender water bottle or the liquid will leak out due to the angle of the compartment.\n",

      "Wish cooled seats were an option- especially in AZ.\n",
      "Rather than a lane change warning system GM would be better off to offer a blind spot warning system built into the side rear view mirrors.\n",
      "Oct 15, 2016Although the lane departure system is a nice option, it would have been far better if GM put in a blind spot warning system.\n",
      "The key is cumbersome and annoying to use, especially since most cars today have push button start.\n",
      "The lane departure system is nice, but not any where near as important as a blind spot warning system.\n",
      "No garage door open built in ... dumb... cup holders are too far back and cups run into one another.\n",
      "Nav system does not work unless radio is on dumb... Jun 28, 2016Not having the blind side safety feature is concerning so we added additional side focus mirrors to the standard mirrors.\n",
      "Also, not having a garage door opener and dual seat/mirror controls is inconvenient.\n",
      "In addition, the center console is positioned too far back making use uncomfortable.\n",
      "Also, drink holders in the front doors would be nice.\n",
      "cargo extender should be automated, seats are uncomfortable, tire pressure gauges don't work, not easy to get into or leave, make trunk bigger, need seat position memory, center console should be moved forward, another cup holder, entertainment package is hard to work, glove compartment is too small,.\n",

      "The door holder does not hold door open when on a slight incline.\n",
      "Difficult to get out of both front seats.\n",
      "It handles very well and seems to have adequate power for normal driving.\n",
      "We are pleased that it has FWD and all-season tires, as well as a well insulated top, heated seats and heated steering wheel.\n",
      "It is FWD for bad weather and has a well insulated convertible top, heated seats and heated steering wheel.\n",
      "I would really like a keyless start option for this model as well as cooled seats and telescoping sun visors.\n",
      "It would be nice if the engine were a bit more powerful and if the gas tank were larger (I feel like I'm having to fill it up more frequently than I did in my Nissan).\n",
      "Doors too big!!\n",
      "Can't make sharp turns as the turning of the wheels can only turn so tight.\n",
      "These are 3 items that come into play every time the engine is started as you head out on the street/road.\n",
      "The car is very hard to get into because I keep the seat forward and I think the wraparound side window causes this.\n",
      "I would have liked power seats and a garage door opener.\n",
      "The interior is plenty roomy and seats are comfortable.\n",
      "The front seat cupholders are too close together and too close to the counsel.\n",

      "Needs built in garage door open.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016I spend more time driving a loaner than my new Cascada, due to multiple and repetitive electrical/computer problems that make the vehicle unsafe to drive, and I certainly will not carry any passengers in it until it is totally fixed.\n",

      "GM - you went backwards on the seat memory functionality.\n",
      "Prior models picked up the stored memory settings when the car was unlocked, but the new version only reacts when the car is started.\n",
      "It is comfortable and easy to drive with all the amenities that you would want.\n",
      "The Buick Enclave is stylish, comfortable, spacious, safe and has advanced technology.\n",
      "I am disappointed that the heads up feature and a CD player were not options when I purchased my new Enclave.\n",

      "Need heads-up display of basic information (speed, direction, gas mileage).\n",
      "I like the interior appointments (e.g., the leather and the faux-wood accents) and the beautiful tri-coat exterior.\n",
      "Price was of only moderate concern but after test-driving BMW and Mercedes-Benz, it was clear that the premiums for those nameplates was not commensurate to the increase in luxury.\n",
      "Jun 6, 2016I like driving a Buick, because it goes completely against type, and after we're all through laughing at the absurdity of ME driving a Buick SUV, I slip into the leather clad drivers seatÃ¢ÂÂthe most comfy driver's seat I've ever been inÃ¢ÂÂand go off to the grocery store, find parking easily cuz my ride is small, yet high and comfy, and get almost 30 miles a gallon doing it.\n",
      "The drivers seat leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "I am not a small woman, and it attacks my thighs, which becomes uncomfortable on 30 minute drives, I tried a pillow to even out the seat, but that raised me up too high.\n",
      "The headrests are an odd configuration, and it took about twenty readjusts to keep it from pushing my head forward.\n",
      "Otherwise, I like the car, the little thing goes fast, and I am saving money on gas.\n",
      "Quiet ride and handles great.\n",
      "Exceptional fuel economy in town and on the highway and is a great value with a premium luxury car warranty and the safety of OnStar.\n",

      "Wheel chair fits in the back.\n",
      "Seats fold down for more room for packages and lots of  groc.\n",
      "Now I have a vehicle I can trust and also put his wheel chair in the back.\n",
      "It's the perfect size, and it's versatile with the hatch and folding rear seats.\n",
      "It's easy to park in tight spaces and comfortable on long trips.\n",
      "Oct 19, 2016My only recommendations to improve the car are to make the engine sound better and make the armrest position when down a little lower.\n",
      "Don't like fact you have to hold seat position button until it completes the transition.\n",
      "Don't like fact there is no.place for garage door opener.\n",

      "At 6000 miles and having the pistons and rod bearing needing replacement, I feel the overall value drops considerably now, owning a new car with a rebuild engine.\n",
      "Someone from Buick disagreed with me, but I know that two cars the same and same price tag, no one would pay the same price for a rebuild engine.\n",
      "The sound system needs to be premium, the vehicle needs more HP, the rear gate should be powered, the locks need to be truly keyless entry, the ignition needs to be keyless, the outside mirrors need to fold powered, the IntelliLink electronics are cumbersome and require too many steps to selection.\n",
      "I enjoy my new vehicle very much it rides very nice, and it is very easy to get in and out of both front and back seats for people of all ages and abilities.\n",
      "The only disappointment to me was this model did not come in full leather seating and two tone option.\n",
      "Buy something different if you want to fold down the rear seats, no driver room if back seats are down.\n",
      "Nice vehicle, but seats and armrest are poor design.\n",
      "Folding down rear seats is a pain (have to pull both front seats forward), and when finished, as a 6'2\" adult, I do not like to drive with my knees in my face.\n",
      "Oct 15, 2016The passenger seat is very uncomfortable and no armrest.\n",
      "Apr 29, 2016Sorely lacking keyless entry, powerlift tail gate and homelink garage opener.\n",
      "Apr 15, 2016Will never purchase another vehicle without:\r\n",
      "Keyless entry\n",
      "Power liftgate.\n",
      "There are only three critiques that I have for the Encore:\r\n",
      "1 - Add additional storage space in the front area, or please at least make that compartment in between the two seats large enough to put an average sized purse.\n",
      "2 - Add grooves or notches to the  lid of the compartment that hides the USB ports so it can be closed while a device is connected and not in the compartment.\n",
      "3 - Move the seat memory buttons off of the top of the driver's seat.\n",
      "It's not conducive for having a family travel in itÃ¢ÂÂparticularly in the front seat area and the amount of cargo space.\n",
      "This is our second Encore, and the feature that we miss not having the most, is the Home Link Remote\" feature used to open the garage door.\n",
      "We also miss a more substantial armrest on the center console.\n",
      "I would like the hatch to automatically lift up with a button on the key fob and I would like a light to go on when the back door open.\n",
      "Nov 20, 2016I am happy with the car - I feel the pick up is a bit sluggish and the rear headrests block my full vision and I would like a passenger side armrest.\n",
      "Oct 27, 2016I feel that all cars should have front and back sensors.\n",
      "The Buick Encore is rather sporty and comfortable to drive.\n",
      "The passenger seat needs to be more comfortable!!\n",
      "Oct 14, 2016The passenger seat should be as comfortable as the driver's seat.\n",
      "Buick should really improve the comfort of the passenger seat.\n",
      "The fact that there is only an armrest on the drivers seat bothers me.\n",
      "More standard features on lowest trim level would be nice, example, HomeLink garage remote in every car, how much more could that cost...same goes for fog lights, it a safety thing.\n",
      "Also add garage door opener, keyless entry, auto rear hatch, available hitch for bikes.\n",
      "Jul 16, 2016No automatic garage door opener or adaptive headlights.\n",
      "Great vehicle for the urban lifestyle unless you need a 3rd-row seat or a lot of cargo space.\n",
      "Please add the following options: Power seatback for front seats, Power Liftgate, active braking, Heads-Up Display, etc.\n",
      "Love the handling, gas mileage and appearance.\n",

      "Oct 27, 2016I love the Buick brand for it's quality and comfort.\n",
      "I wish however the side mirrors would fold in, the backup screen would have a beep like my dad's Buick does, and the trunk had an automatic lift/closure, or was not quite so high.\n",
      "All the people that have rode in my car in the front passenger seat have complained about the headrest leaning inward to much, which makes it uncomfortable.\n",
      "The cupholders and cubby between the front seats is not convenient for a shorter person.\n",
      "I don' t always use the backup camera.\n",
      "When the roads are messy, the image on the back up camera is blurry, once it's washed, it's fine.\n",
      "The Encore AWD has its good and bad qualities.\n",
      "The sound system is in-adept, and the customization of the navigation system and the sound system is far from user friendly.\n",
      "It would convenient to have a button near the driver that would open the rear storage area of the Encore.\n",
      "The Buick Encore AWD SUV is the best vehicle on the market for the money and residual value.\n",
      "A great improvement over the last model, like the color, still has more road noise than I like and the stereo still sucks.\n",
      "Check Engine light also came on just recently, again under two months of driving it!\n",
      "I think the vertical adjustment of the front seats back should be electric not manual.\n",
      "Most other vehicles have navigation without charge.\n",
      "The interior is beautiful, and I enjoy the smooth ride.\n",
      "The all wheel drive makes a big difference in how this vehicle handles on the road compared to the 2015 Encore w/o AWD.\n",

      "The performance, the brakes, and the handling are superb, and the engine and exhaust sounds are incredible.\n",
      "Being a retired ASE master tech, I really appreciate all the engineering that went into this car.\n",
      "The one glaring lack in my ATS-V is the lack of adaptive cruise control with full-authority collision avoidance braking.\n",

      "Having problems with iPod in vehicle and steering noises.\n",
      "Very nice, comfortable large vehicle with beautiful contemporary design and many comfort and safety features.\n",
      "Rides and handles very well.\n",
      "However, the interior color selections are very poor unless you like high contrast black carpet, dash and trim piece combinations with either grey, orange or neutral seats).\n",
      "There are no light monochromatic interiors available and the black steering wheel (unless you opt for the Platinum) is extremely plain.\n",
      "The car is a pleasure to drive and the Bose Panaray Sound system, massaging seating functions, and extended comfort reclining rear seats in the Platinum trim level are really amazing additions to the car.\n",
      "The centerpiece of the steering wheel should have been Maple Sugar not black.\n",
      "The center of the dash should have been covered with very light cashmere perforated   leather to match the seating, not the black perforated leather from the other models.\n",
      "The ceiling (headliner) and pillars of the interior should have been very light cashmere to match the upholstery of the seating rather than the color of the floor/carpet.\n",
      "The ambient lighting in the doors should have been white like the other LED lights rather than orange.\n",
      "Ideally the color and brightness of the ambient lighting should be adjustable as it is in Mercedes, Range Rover, etc.\n",
      "It would also be nice to have red illuminated hazard warning lights in addition to the white LED lights in all four doors as are in European luxury cars and Cadillacs of the distant past.\n",
      "There should be a control for the rear seat passengers to heat only the seat backs as there is for the front seat passengers.\n",
      "This allows for a heated back message without having the seat cushion unnecessarily heating your rear end as well.\n",
      "It should be retained because of its beauty but other lighting should be placed above the trunk compartment under the back window and/or under the trunk deck lid to actually illuminate the trunk compartment.\n",
      "The camera rear view mirror is an excellent idea however, I can't use it because it seems to distort the distance of the objects behind the car (like the side mirrors) and the glare on it both in sunlight and nighttime is so great that the image is so dim I feel like I am driving blindly.\n",
      "Hopefully, this can be improved as I can't use this feature at all.\n",
      "If they can't be used on the bottom of the car maybe the back up lights should be moved to the base of each taillight.\n",
      "The wheels on my Platinum XTS with the chrome inserts looked so much better in the bright polished aluminum rather than the painted ones on my new Platinum CT6.\n",
      "Changing the non chrome parts of the wheels to the bright highly polished aluminum would look so much better and be much shinier.\n",
      "If the interior had medium taupe carpet and dash instead of the high contrast black it would have been much more spacious looking and would go better with the exterior colors other than black or silver particularly the red, green, and blue colors.\n",
      "The luxury/premium models light platinum should have had the urban color (from the XTS Platinum) for the dash and carpet instead of the black.\n",
      "The back of the front seats and seat frames should also match the seat upholstery not the floor of the car.\n",
      "The black seat backs make the back seat area look very small and busy.\n",
      "In addition, the pillars of the car should match the top/headliner and seat upholstery not the carpet on the floor.\n",
      "Finally, the plain black steering wheels are very plain and look like a generic black vinyl steering wheel out of a much lesser car.\n",
      "The rear end of the car is very plain and the Cadillac name is nowhere on the exterior (or interior).\n",
      "The wheels are a beautiful design but would have been more brilliant and nicer had they been polished aluminum with the chrome inserts instead of the silver painted surface.\n",
      "In an $85,000 Platinum trim level one would expect the center of the steering wheel and dash to match the rest of the interior rather than be the generic black plastic and vinyl of all the other trim levels.\n",
      "The center of the steering wheel should be Maple Sugar and the center of the dash should be the perforated Very Light Cashmere which is used in the seating area (not the generic black perforated material used in the other black dash models).\n",
      "Also, my preference for the headliner would have been Very Light Cashmere rather than Maple Sugar as the top and side pillars matching the seating and upholstery rather than the floor of the car makes more sense and is better balanced.\n",
      "I hate the orange color of the ambient lighting along the dash and door panels.\n",
      "These lights should either be white like the rest of the LED lights or preferably adjustable in color and brightness.\n",
      "In addition, these lights should go all the way across the bottom of the dash (even above the A/C vents) to the steering column opening to complete the lighting bar and design.\n",
      "Illuminated red hazard warning lights in each of the four doors in addition to the white courtesy lights would also be a very nice feature and add to safety as it is in many European cars and was in the Cadillacs of the past.\n",
      "The back seats should have the option to heat only the seat backs as the front seats do as many people prefer to heat the seat back only when using the message functions (even in warm seasons with the A/C on).\n",
      "There should be at least one monochromatic, light colored, neutral interior selection for the Luxury and Premium trim levels.\n",
      "The lower doors, door frames, backs of the front seats and front seat frames should match the seat upholstery (at least on the light platinum) and the side pillars in the top of the car should also be light platinum matching the headliner and not the floor of the car.\n",
      "A lighter color such as Dark Urban would have been a more neutral, spacious looking accent color for the steering wheel, dash, tops of the doors and floor rather than the high contrasting harsh black.\n",
      "This lighter, neutral interior would be much smarter and more tasteful especially with the Green, Blue, Red, White and Silver exteriors rather than the jarring two-tone black and gray or orange interiors you currently offer.\n",
      "Although it would have been better had you used taupe rather than black for the accent, dash and carpet color.\n",
      "If the light cashmere/maple sugar Platinum trim hadn't been possible for me, I would have gone to another brand based upon interior color selection alone.\n",
      "I only feel comfortable driving vehicles with light colored, harmonious, spacious looking, monochromatic interiors.\n",
      "The camera based rear view mirror is a great idea, but the scale of the image appears to be like the right side mirror making objects seem much further away than they really are.\n",
      "This makes me very uncomfortable so unfortunately, I can never use this feature.\n",
      "The auto-stop feature is very annoying to me as the car feels like it is dying out every time you stop.\n",
      "I think this is a good option to have in some instances, however, the default for this feature should be the \"off\" position and not the \"on\" position (like the auto-hold function).\n",
      "The back up lights should be LED to go with the rest of the exterior LED lights as they look very old and yellow in comparison.\n",
      "The ambient lighting color and brightness should be adjustable as I loved the bright white ambient lighting in the XTS and hate the dim orange ambient lighting in the CT6.\n",
      "The ambient lighting should also continue on the dash where the A/C vents are to give a nice continuous flow of light.\n",
      "The center of the steering wheel and the perforated black area on the dash should match the dash color instead of being black.\n",
      "Although the cashmere/maple sugar Platinum interior is beautiful, I prefer the headliner of the interior to be the same color or lighter than the upholstery rather than matching the carpet.\n",
      "I would have use the cashmere color for the headliner and pillars.\n",
      "Illuminated red hazard warning lights in addition to the LED's in the four doors would also be a nice touch as in some of the other luxury brands.\n",
      "The color selections should include one light monochromatic color scheme that does not have black dash, carpet, seat or door frames or ceiling pillars.\n",
      "The closest thing to that now is the base model neutral color but it is spoiled by the harsh black carpet and dash.\n",
      "It would have been much better with a lighter taupe color than the high contrast black.\n",
      "Also, the light platinum interior should not have the black seat frames, door frames and pillars.\n",
      "You should also revisit the wood being used in the interiors.\n",
      "I much prefer the highly polished aluminum wheels with the chrome inserts (like I had on the Platinum XTS) over the painted wheels with the chrome inserts on the Platinum CT6.\n",
      "There should be lighting in the back/ceiling of the trunk under the rear windshield area as well as the ones at the very back of the car because if there are packages up against those lights the lighting is blocked and there is no light in the trunk.\n",
      "It would be great to see the Cadillac name somewhere on the interior and exterior of the CT6.\n",
      "Need headlight brights-on and turn signal indicators on head-up display.\n",
      "Doors won't stay open when opened from inside.\n",
      "Driver is constantly fighting the door as he/she climbs out.\n",
      "Suggest a concise how-to card for the infotainment center in the rear seat to support new users.\n",
      "The driver can't control enough of what needs to be done to be helpful when a new passenger is trying to use the LED screen and audio system in the rear.\n",
      "Comfortable ride.\n",
      "Not perfect, there are a few hiccups like auto stop and mirrors but overall a pleasure.\n",
      "Please look at some of the features , like auto-stop.\n",
      "The auto stop feature s quite annoying and I'm sure is not saving me that much in gas.\n",
      "My sunroof creaks/ rattles, for a 3-4 month old to rattle so early is disconcerting.\n",
      "Also the back of the drivers seat is pulling back, again disconcerting.\n",
      "Nov 9, 2016I would like to recommend Cadillac use a higher quality of carpet.\n",
      "The cloth floor-mats are too light in color and soil easily.\n",
      "I am not crazy about always having to push the console button to hold the car in place when in gear.\n",
      "Heat off dash while driving is very uncomfortable.\n",
      "The display for the interior heater/a-c temperature is too difficult to see and read, especially in bright sunlight.\n",
      "Great styling, comfortable, pleasure to drive\n",
      "The gas tank door is on the wrong side of the car.\n",
      "However, I would like the option to set the \"stop/start\" feature as the owner, would like front park assist camera, a CD would also be desirable as well.\n",
      "Additionally, more storage space especially in the armrest area, more USB ports and retractable side mirrors are a few suggestions to consider.\n",
      "I am still not sure how anyone could make a vehicle with leather seating surface?\n",
      "Cadillac is the only vehicle I have owned with leather seat surface.\n",
      "I am still getting use to the que, I do like it .the auto stop mechanism I could have done with out.\n",
      "The auto-off feature while stopped is a bit of a pain.\n",
      "And a better job of sizing phones so that your wireless charging pad can actually fit about half the phones in use would be helpful.\n",
      "Nice feature, but I can't use it with my Samsung phone.\n",
      "My wife says the passenger seat headrest is uncomfortable.\n",
      "Cannot get the USB music to play.\n",
      "Eventually will damage left side of driver's seat.\n",
      "Using transmission to hold speed going down hill wasteful of fuel and expensive transmission wear.\n",
      "Using brakes would be better.\n",
      "Cannot get the temperature to stay comfortable without constantly changing it with AC.\n",
      "Haven't used heat yet.\n",
      "Hard to get out of seat without my butt pushing down on the drivers seat side, will be wear and tear on the seat eventually.\n",
      "Auto dimming headlights best I've ever had on a Cadillac.\n",
      "Cannot get USB stick to work playing music in the USB port in the dash behind the door or in the center console.\n",
      "Seem to be dealing with a number of small electrical gliches with this vehicle like tailgate not opening with foot motion, dash settings changing on their own, heater/ AC offline and not working then working again after vehicle was turned back on, vehicle not showing speed limit on head-up display, side mirror detection system turning itself off, etc.\n",
      "I would not recommend this vehicle if you intended to carry any type of lift to carry a power chair or scooter as none of the safety features on the vehicle will work with a lift installed.\n",
      "I would not have purchased this vehicle if I had known that the safety features would be inoperable.\n",
      "The Escalade has all the latest safety, comfort and convenience features that I value.\n",
      "The one I'm driving now is the 5th I have owned, so I'm very satisfied with the vehicle, especially the luxury features, power, and its capacity to carry lots of passengers and all their stuff.\n",
      "A great choice for those seeking an excellent ride with over 7000 pound towing capacity that will seat six adults reasonably comfortably.\n",
      "Wireless charging pad needs to have a new rubber cover without a rib provided for customers with the latest larger cell phones.\n",
      "In addition, some of the buried sub-menus are displayed for too short a time and hinder safety.\n",
      "It looks attractive but in actual use it requires the driver to take time away from driving to look at the the many choices.\n",
      "Check vehicle carefully at delivery time for paint defects and ancillary equipment (remotes, headphones, mats, etc).\n",
      "The front and rear low speed cameras help but I would like to have a better and safer field of vision.\n",
      "The interactive dashboard is not easy to use.\n",
      "The only issue I have is the quality of the materials used.\n",
      "The Cadillac Escalade is very safe to drive in all kinds of weather.\n",
      "Great vehicle, great ride, quiet, excellent performance.\n",
      "Other than the above, the ride is excellent, and the speaker performance is amazing.\n",
      "The transmission controller is odd and takes some getting used to.\n",
      "Exterior lighting is poor on the sides.\n",
      "You need side mirror indicators as well as programmable power folding side mirrors.\n",
      "The door handles should light up all the time (at night) and are useful when making turns and should indicate as well.\n",
      "The hands-free release for the hatch door had never worked since day one.\n",
      "Why did you make the map pockets in the doors smaller?\n",
      "The heads-up display should have the left and right indicator lights and hi-beams on.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "This is my second CUE system Cadillac, and it's still not working correctly.\n",
      "The rear seats should be power folding.\n",
      "How about that same idea for the sideview mirrors?\n",
      "The speech commands should control the sunroof and windows.\n",

      "I highly recommend the Cadillac XT5 Platinum edition for anyone looking for comfort, style, high tech, power and quality.\n",
      "The electronic shifter is very easy to master and the lack of knobs makes dusting the dash.console so much easier.\n",
      "I dont like that the 5 -way button on teh right hand of the steering wheel cannot be customized to do more - ALL it does is cycle thru the small readout options.\n",
      "3. the up and down seek buttons onteh right hand part of the steering wheel only change audio tracks on playlists and favorites in the radio memory.\n",
      "the only way to flip thru the channels is to take ur eyes off the road and use the seek button on the center console which is annoying.\n",
      "Give us a choice, I would rather have the other engine that does not shut down every time I put my foot on the brake.\n",
      "It sounds like I am driving a piece of junk.\n",
      "The car drives and rides good but the stopping and starting sucks.\n",
      "I also own a 2016 GMC Canyon four-door pickup, which I love.\n",
      "Should be a more public warning about issues with the leather seating, On-Star road-side service is really not a 24 hour operation and interior accessories such as floor mats should be available upon introduction of a vehicle .... not months later!\n",
      "Very nice interior, styling is not much different than the SRX.\n",
      "handling is good for a SUV I am tired of the extended warrenty sales pitch especially when it takes up too much time when trying to finish the paper work.\n",
      "It was an important safety feature when making a phone call.\n",
      "The Cadillac XT5 is a great vehicle, lots of safety features, quiet, adequate room, runs great, fit & finish very good, and fun to drive.\n",
      "Our only two negitives about our XT5 are: 1) Interior storage is sacrificed for cup holders and 2) \r\n",

      "HAVE AUTO LIFT GATE ON ALL MODELS.\n",
      "Dec 1, 2016Should come with auto lift gate on all of the XT5's.\n",
      "The only quibble that I have is the efficiency of the windshield defroster.\n",
      "Great vehicle but could use about 4 to 6  more inches depth in rear cargo space.\n",
      "Big improvement over previous model year in terms of mileage, handling, look, and luxury  appointments.\n",

      "Oct 4, 2016Love also the taillights and LED lights, the back seat has ample room.\n",
      "I hate the push button controls on the steeriring wheel.\n",
      "Also a manual slide for  radio and phone contacts would be much safer during driving.\n",
      "The cheap plastic string and plastic hook that hold the spare tire cover up is my pet peeve.\n",
      "Oct 14, 2016The one small problem I had was some minor wind noise because of a seal in the top sunroof that had been mashed flat.\n",

      "The mileage is terrible because the engine has to work overtime to move the vehicle and the responsiveness is awful.\n",
      "When equipped with the V-6, the Journey is much more responsive and can actually be considered fun to drive with ample power to pass and maneuver on the highway.\n",
      "Only that I think a power driver's seat should be standard equipment in the vehicle, regardless of the trim level.\n",

      "It did not include a nav/infotainment system, backup camera, power liftgate, leather seats, or even a power driver's seat.\n",
      "I've come to realize that it's full but the connection to the tank is broken.\n",
      "Also, following a safety recall where the transmission was removed to fix the problem, the transmission now hesitates.\n",
      "The size of the headrests interfere somewhat when the driver is looking to their right and backing.\n",
      "It's a nice vehicle to drive, plenty of room for young children to get in and out of not a bad looking vehicle, for someone who cannot afford a luxury vehicle.\n",

      "I have no ideal why, however my (driver) heated seat and steering wheel automatically turn on when I start the engine.\n",
      "The door master switch was defective 2 weeks after purchase, and the lift gate hatch handle was defective after 2 months.\n",
      "Need more color choices available for both interior and exterior.\n",
      "The vehicle represents a good value for the money with decent ride quality.\n",
      "The engine sounds very loud and makes a knocking noise only 9,000 miles in.\n",
      "Does not have Navigation systems, not the best fuel mileage in its class.\n",

      "I would like the availability either as standard or as an accessory of metal door sill covers.\n",

      "The hands free options are easy to use and I use the bluetooth connectivity to play music and make phone calls.\n",
      "Little things like, automatic air conditioning (I am always adjusting the temperature in the truck), auto folding side mirrors (parking the truck is not easy, but tight spots make folding the mirrors a pain).\n",
      "The seats are too short for me, there is not enough support out to my knees, and the sound system is simply terrible.\n",
      "On a positive note, the truck rides well, it is reasonably quiet (although there is a whistling noise from the seal around the drivers door), the fuel economy is impressive, and the cargo and interior space is phenomenal.\n",
      "I don't like using my phone for navigation as it is difficult to read while driving.\n",
      "I use my vehicle for construction so I am going to various sites that I may be unfamiliar with, so navigation is a must.\n",
      "This truck is loaded with the latest technology, which complements the overall driving experience and elevates that experience to very high level.\n",
      "The ride is very firm and stable in all road conditions, and I feel safe and in control at all times.\n",
      "I would also add that on the highway the ride is smooth and relaxing, while very quiet, eliminating tire and road noise at a level I had not experienced before.\n",
      "Try to refine the console and door components to an upgraded composite material.\n",
      "The appearance in some areas looks like cheap and inexpensive plastic and detracts from the fit and finish of the dash and seat areas.\n",
      "They have not engineered the weight to MPG ratio to get better gas milage (i.e., lighter truck should create better gas milage).\n",
      "Lighter truck should be engineered to create better gas milage.\n",
      "They made it lighter, but it gets worse gas milage than my old 2008 F-150.\n",

      "Cruise control switches are in an awkward place on steering wheel and center console fan switches need to be bigger and in a better location.\n",
      "It actually gives an audible alarm if you inadvertantly move into an occupied lane whereas the F150 sytem just shows an orange ligh in the mirror!\n",

      "The wide angle \"dots\" on side mirrors obstruct my rear view.\n",
      "the left and right mirrors have terrible blind spots  most mirrors today have built in blind spot mirrors this truck does not  my 2016 super duty has blind spot mirrors and even my 2016 xl f-150 has them but not the f-150 lariat come on bad move ford.\n",

      "All it needs is a blow off valve.\n",
      "Very happy with my 150, a few things could be improved: the garage door opener has poor range, backup camera is extremely grainy, and console could be designed better.\n",
      "Some one egged the tailgate and it chipped the paint in the form of the egg in just little spots, I bought some Ford touch-up paint and you cannot see where it hit.\n",

      "I only noticed after failing to park straight when using the camera solely to align myself.\n",
      "Second, the Sync system has once each month, almost to the day randomly decided to boot by phone off of bluetooth and then freeze up and not allow pairing, and requiring battery disconnection to reset.\n",
      "Things I would change or add as options:  the cruise control module would serve me better on the right side of the steering wheel as opposed to the left (maybe just me), the key fob allows for remote unlocking and unlatching of the rear hatch, but assisted opening would be very nice (perhaps a higher option than I bought), and the fold-flat rear seats could benefit from head rests that fold away rather than necessitate removal to facilitate the folding.\n",
      "I think it stands out from the crowd in sporty styling and quality of build both inside and out.\n",
      "It balances engine performance with fuel efficiency very nicely.\n",
      "You'd be surprised the number of cars that you sit in and find you cannot rest your leg against the door or center console without something digging into you.\n",

      "Needs standard lumbar support in every grade of seat; the ST1 does not have good lumbar support.\n",
      "At risk of sounding like a broken record, please investigate putting decent lumbar support in your seats whether or not the lumbar support is adjustable!\n",
      "Seat has completely inadequate lumbar support and manual lumbar adjustment SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT on every level of Ford Focus.\n",
      "I await the day when Ford Motor Company begins taking seat comfort more seriously.\n",
      "Oct 31, 2016I would just reiterate that more work is needed on both the standard and optional seats.\n",
      "Poor lumbar support would seem to me to be easily fixable.\n",
      "The cup holders are in a bad position, as is the accelerator, and a bit shorter throw of the shifter would be nice.\n",
      "I drive around 150 miles a day, it would be nice not to have to stop for gas every other day.\n",
      "The cup holders are in the way of the shifter, the armrest is in an awkward spot, (adjustable for and aft would be great) the accelerator pedal is in a bad spot, too low, and the rattles are nerve racking, but I am a bit OCD about noises, so don't take that to heart.\n",
      "of all of these cars I've owned, this is by far, the most practical, and powerful, and most efficient, but not as much fun.\n",

      "I push the trunk button from the front seat and when I get out of the car and close the driver door, the trunk closes and locks.\n",
      "Then when I open it with the key button, it open about a 1/4 inch then I have to put everything in my hands down and open the trunk with both hands.\n",
      "My last focus opened all the way when I pushed any trunk key button.\n",
      "It handles magnificently for the type of vehicle it is, plus has a large amount of power for take off and acceleration to the point where modification is almost unnecessary.\n",
      "interior is exceptional, the way the seats hug and keep you in, plus with the ease and useability of the sync 3 system, there are virtually no distractions.\n",
      "I bought the car about 6 months ago and I still enjoy getting behind the wheel.\n",
      "The front wheel well liners have screws that come loose.\n",
      "Also, there needs to be more insulation in the vehicle so that the sound of the doors and trunk closing shift do not sound clangy.\n",
      "Nov 20, 2016Put more insulation in doors so you don't get the clang sound when closing doors.\n",
      "Ford performance needs to get the wheel hopping under control as it can be unsettling if not expected.\n",
      "The vehicle could use a more linear powerband as power drops off rather quickly and the car goes flat.\n",

      "It would be nice to have a universal homelink/dimming rear mirror and a dead pedal...I had to buy one.\n",

      "The only complaint I've heard about my Ford Focus is from my two adult children, they say there isn't enough legroom in the back seat.\n",
      "Excellent price for the performance.\n",
      "Great mileage, and an excellent vehicle for someone who still loves to drive a manual transmission car.\n",
      "There is a rattle that is driving me crazy, doesn't happen all the time but when it does...it won't stop.\n",
      "Small, economical vehicle that rides and handles well.\n",
      "Great gas milage,  plenty of room and cargo space.\n",
      "Disappointed in transmission  and amount of tire/road noise.\n",
      "Please consider adding power to the hatchback's tailgate.\n",
      "The fuel tank is small, however the car handles like a dream and has more power than you really need in a car this small.\n",
      "It's got some tech improvements that I really like, rearview camera and it's capability to call just by voice commands.\n",
      "The steering and brakes are very responsive.\n",

      "Love the heated seats and steering wheel.\n",
      "I absolutely HATE how difficult it was to program my phone and music selections.\n",
      "The ride is comfortable, and there is good acceleration performance for a hybrid.\n",
      "Some corners are cut on the interior with very cheap floor mats and fabric panels on the console side of leather seating.\n",
      "There fabric substitution is an okay idea to conserve leather, but it should not be so high on the seat that it is within touch reach when resting your hand on the seat.\n",
      "The \"Adaptive cruise control\" is a very useful feature, but where is the automated braking to avoid front end collisions found on competing brands of same year?\n",
      "The exterior features excellent accent lighting with the LED eyebrows and downlighting placed in the side mirrors.\n",
      "The rear bumper, sill panels and entire front of the car is not even close to matching the the hood, fenders, doors or roof of the car.\n",
      "My Fusion easily meets the conditions for warrantable repair described, however Ford has declined repairing the defect, claiming the defect is not inconsistent to some of their other cars of the same paint color.\n",
      "It is important to note the wet primer paint process used in finishing cars these days is honorable in that it reduces greenhouse gas emissions in addition to cutting manufacturer costs.\n",
      "My local auto body repair shop told me if they finished a car with the same paint mismatch, the insurance company would not accept it and would require it to be refinished again.\n",
      "Because Ford has declined honoring the paint defect warranty as described and documented in their own bulletin, they have breached all trust with me as a consumer and therefore my recommendation is avoid Ford for consideration in auto purchases.\n",
      "The bottom line is a premium paint finish was paid for, which might indicate to Ford paint finish is an important feature to consumers who select these options!!!\n",
      "The interior styling is exquisite, and the ride comfort is truly an accomplishmentÃ¢ÂÂthe single best feature of the Fusion.\n",
      "Some shortcuts in materials and craftsmanship should be addressed in future models, namely the use of leather side panels on leather seating rather than fabric, and poor quality floor mats.\n",
      "The absence of front end auto braking is nothing less than disappointing, surprising given the competition and other technology features included in the car.\n",
      "The mismatch of exterior paint color/finish on exterior body panels is a critical error and quality control issue that will prevent me from purchasing from Ford again, regardless of how nice the rest of the car is.\n",
      "Sep 5, 2016A few things: Please do not stereotype hybrid owners or assume we do not appreciate sporty and luxury features!\n",
      "Recommend wrapping the entire seat in leather rather than using cloth on the interior portion of seat next to center console or at least use leather as far as someone would reach with their fingers.\n",
      "Allow the consumer to specify wheel type!\n",
      "Has great features at a good price.\n",

      "I am pleasantly surprised by the power and acceleration.\n",
      "I'm happy with the overall comfort and performance.\n",
      "The touch pad at my storage unit is more responsive.\n",
      "However, as my driving habits change, I feel I do not need the all wheel drive feature and will most likely go back to a Fusion Hybrid on my next purchase.\n",
      "It is a well put together unit and the quality & performance are outstanding.\n",
      "I had a previous Fusion Hybrid but it only had front wheel drive.\n",
      "I went with the all wheel drive this time.\n",
      "However, I found a good deal money wise and this car had quite a few features I wanted (not needed).\n",
      "Dec 4, 2016It would be best if it was clearer on the performance with respect to which octane rating was used for the numbers.\n",
      "It would also be helpful to have more information on the digital displays in the dash.\n",
      "They are very limited in their customization, the left display is cluttered with all of the car info (tachometer, fuel gauge, temp gauge, cruise control, lane departure, etc.\n",
      "It would be nice to move some items from the left to the right, it would also be helpful to display the battery voltage given how much more devices there are in the new vehicle.\n",
      "However, the front seats are not comfortable, too short for good thigh support, and it's hard to find a comfortable seating position.\n",
      "Feb 16, 2016Although the Ford Fusion Hybrid is a good vehicle, there are some issues: One, the seats are too short and don't provide enough support under the thighs.\n",
      "Now if I could get the seats from the Chevrolet Impala LTZ on the Fusion, WOW that would be great.\n",
      "It allows driving short distances using only electric mode and has the flexibility of a gasoline engine/traditional hybrid powertrain for longer distances without ever experiencing range anxiety.\n",
      "The Fusion is a great all-around car that is comfortable, just the right size, stylish, and fun to drive.\n",
      "It is loaded with safety features and is a card you can be proud to own.\n",
      "Apr 18, 2016My favorite feature of my Ford Fusion is the warning system when changing lanes, backing up, or just driving on a super highway.\n",
      "Very comfortable ride.\n",

      "It's sporty looking, fun, and comfortable to drive, and it gets great gas mileage.\n",
      "We have a 2010 Escape, and the cruise in that is a whole lot easier to use.\n",
      "I keep accidentally connecting with it and turning on the wipers when I try to change the radio or do other things on the center console.\n",
      "It seems too close to the steering wheel.\n",
      "Apr 30, 2016We are enjoying our new vehicle and the comfortable ride.\n",
      "Seat support is outstanding.\n",
      "Seats are very comfortable\r\n",

      "4.\n",
      "Electronic infotainment system is very useful and well layed out.\n",
      "My 2017 Ford Fusion SE 2.0L AWD is a great vehicle except for two things: The fuel economy is completely unacceptable (~17 MPG combined).\n",
      "I love many things about the Fords I have owned, but no one gets the mileage out of EcoBoost engines that the window sticker says they will.\n",
      "This car has lots of features that I have never seen before, and we were not shown most of them so we are muddling through as we proceed (like the windows down and moonroof open feature).\n",
      "Two things we would change: the tilt wheel lever is way too far down the column and the key start in the column is way less convenient than the Grand Caravan or the Corvette, which are in the instrument panel.\n",
      "It sold me first and comfortable seats.\n",
      "Aug 7, 2016quite interior and comfortable seats are huge.\n",
      "I like to use my Google Map on the Sync 2 screen.\n",
      "The engine noise is unacceptable.\n",
      "A new, high-tech engine should not sound as awful as my 2017 Fusion engine sounds at idle.\n",
      "The low-beam headlights do not light up enough roadway.\n",
      "The vehicle is \"tinny\" or cheap feeling when you open and close the doors, trunk lid, and hood.\n",
      "I would like to see brighter 'dim' and 'high-beam' headlights.\n",
      "Fit & Finish - the metal and plastic body parts need to fit/connect better - our vehicle is white and the two colors are not exactly the same.\n",
      "Small lip is needed above the touchscreen - again similar to Escape - prevent touching screen when adjusting heating/cooling vents above the screen.\n",
      "The trunk/rear deck lid seems a little \"flimsy\" on closure.\n",
      "Recall on headlamps when I bought it, it did not have all options I thought it had, I hate the automatic engine start-stop feature.\n",
      "Oct 5, 2016I was told I would be able to use a Ford Fusion app that would let me remote start my car get theft alarms & so forth, but apparently all I can do is get service reminders & see how much fuel I have left.\n",
      "It gets wonderful gas mileage and is very smooth and quiet, but it's a little boring to drive.\n",

      "Once you get used to driving with a hybrid you can get a great range out of this car.\n",
      "Tire pressure on dash.\n",
      "Nov 19, 2016I would like to see tire pressure displayed on screen.\n",
      "Oct 13, 2016Two things, first need to have tire pressure displayed.\n",
      "Second, need larger battery for more driving distance.\n",
      "I would like the electric charge for the car to last longer than it does, the interior of the new Fusion appears to be smaller, less legroom in the rear for passengers, and the trunk is virtually useless to carry items in.\n",
      "My only complaints are lack of spare tire and reduced trunk space due to the HV battery.\n",
      "At last trip to the dealer, a driver door module was reprogrammed to supposedly correct the problem & prevent its future reoccurrence.\n",
      "The feature preventing a tire from falling into a pothole doesn't work.\n",

      "Excellent build quality, great mileage and very comfortable.\n",
      "Would be nice to squeeze a little more out of the battery on the electric portion of the drive.\n",
      "The one issue I have is that if my car is in drive and I put it in reverse to back up and hit the gas, the whole car shakes like I may be overworking the transmission.\n",
      "Some trim piece fitments on the exterior door handles fall short of good.\n",
      "Heated rear seat option.\n",

      "Aug 20, 2016The blind spot mirrors should be available on all vehicles regardless of the package you choose.\n",
      "Cellphone picks up A/C noise all the time.\n",
      "Advice I received was to turn off the A/C if using the cellphone in the car.\n",
      "Also I am not sure if the preset driver seat settings change the position of the seat or just the mirrors.\n",
      "Well made, comfortable & handles very well in all types of road conditions.\n",
      "It is amazing, fun to drive, and wonderful on fuel economy.\n",
      "Oct 15, 2016The back of the drivers seat is coming apart, I just need to take it in.\n",

      "Would like some type of phone holder built in.\n",
      "A spare tire even might not be used but provides security that you will not be stranded in the middle of the night far away from the next town and waste the time and money.\n",
      "Just add a spare tire and improve the options in the satellite radio and navigation system to accept the apps from smartphones.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016Sport cars front seats are comfortable, and this model's are excellent with cool/heat optionÃ¢ÂÂlove it, but not as good in the back.\n",
      "But Ford Mustangs have an excellent and comfort seat in the back if you are short person 5.6 or less.\n",
      "We can do better with the advancements guys, help us stop the use of third party add-ons, just to bring it up to tech standards.\n",
      "Aug 13, 2016Not having a original SVT-built 2016 Cobra is probably the reason for the bland design and poor use of technology, where lower-end vehicles are better equipped, offer better interior customization, and are proving you don't need to nickel and dime your diehard Mustang owners.\n",
      "Jul 23, 2016I have a few things that I'm not too happy about when it came to the interior design, zero heads-up display, interior lighting as well as the exterior lighting.\n",
      "Maybe I am too used to the quick response of the previous vehicles' manual transmission, but this drawback certainly takes away from the driving experience.\n",
      "Quality control, paint, panel fit are unsatisfactory.\n",
      "It is a \"tech pack\" model, which is equipped as I want, except that it does not have transmission or differential coolers, which were not an option and limits performance.\n",
      "Other factors should be also considered such as the terrain, the extent of gas pedal, the car's speed etc.\n",
      "The electric-assisted steering really should be improved on its road-feedback.\n",
      "I chose the 2016 Mustang because in the past view years the body styles seemed to reflect more of the original styling of the 1960s when I was a teenager...and the price for a 300HP convertible was reasonable considering the cost of cars today.\n",
      "I very much enjoy driving the Mustang and have received numerous compliments on its looks and styling.\n",
      "Having lived with the car for a few months, we have found that the passenger side is less adjustable than we would like and that the passenger attempting to fiddle with the heating-air conditioning or the radio interferes with the driver shifting the car.\n",
      "Also I find all the buttons for the sound system a bit too complex.\n",
      "I like technology, but when driving I want my concentration to be on the road, not the phone or trying to find music or radio stations.\n",
      "The rear end breaks out under acceleration (oversteer) more than I like, but it's catchable.\n",
      "YES, I wanted the V-6, but it could NOT be ordered with leather heated seats.\n",

      "The EcoBoost Mustang has artificial motor sounds played through the stereo.\n",
      "Ford Mustang GT with Performance Package option is a party on wheels.\n",
      "Mustang GT (base) with Performance Package was a compelling value for money.\n",
      "Add on that with the hard top (I had a 2005 convertible mustang), the back seats fold down, which is awesome.\n",

      "Interior and exterior.\n",
      "Seat cushions could use a bit more padding.\n",
      "Otherwise I love this car, the power, sound, and Sync 3.\n",
      "Oct 14, 2016In general, I love the car, but the fit and finish could be a bit better, and the seat leather is as thin as a piece of paper.\n",
      "When a customer orders chrome wheels, give him chrome wheels, this is the 2nd Mustang I've ordered with Chrome wheels and end up getting black wheels.\n",
      "The car has performance that will not disappoint, it has most of the current technology in all aspects.\n",
      "I plan to hold Ford accountable for delivering a quality car with a high degree of engineering and reliability.\n",

      "The best is an evening drive on a country road, stereo playing, and top down.\n",
      "Fun to drive Said a few years ago Mr. Ford , if you keep  building quality you will always have costumers buying your vehicles.\n",
      "The worst was like a grey grease residue smeared with fingerprints on the rubber covers on the rear seatbelts.\n",

      "Good diesel power with less mpg than expected.\n",
      "It has great power and rides like a dream.\n",
      "Like the performance and mileage when towing.\n",
      "It could ride a little smoother when not pulling a load, but I bought the tow package and it comes with the territory.\n",
      "I would love to thank all engineers at Ford for their excellence in exceeding the vehicles qualities in all areas (technology, style, economy, etc.\n",
      "It's a good truck, get 4 door We are tired of the emission systems.\n",
      "This specific new vehicle should not have passed paint inspection, it was as if someone had smeared the initial paint job and the dealership was not willing to discount the car but was willing to \"touch up\" the paint.\n",
      "Please also do trail tests to see if three child safety seats can buckle easily and fit flat in the rear bucket seat.\n",

      "I am disappointed with the location and readability of the gas and coolant temperature gauges.\n",
      "I have a cargo van with no rear or side windows, and I wanted it that way, but Ford should include as standard a blind spot warning system and yellow turn signal warning lights on the side mirrors.\n",
      "A standard radio came with the van and reaching the radio buttons is a stretch even for a tall person, it would be a safety feature to have station selection and volume control mounted on the steering wheel.\n",

      "The only thing I would change if I could is roominess of the drivers seat.\n",
      "My middle seats would not unfold.\n",
      "Why not improve safety and convenience by providing an entry assist handle on the driver's side windshield pillar just the same as you provided on the passenger front side (is the driver less entitled to safety and convenience that the passenger?)\n",

      "Note that I have had AC parts replaced under warranty, but it is still only marginal performance, and I am frequently uncomfortable.\n",
      "I love the vehicle for what it is...big, roomy and comfortable for the family.\n",
      "The shortcomings are insufficient air conditioning capacity for a black vehicle and 100+ degree weather, the sliding door has begun to develop a rattle with less than 10,000 miles, the interior lighting is too dim in back when kids want to read, and the sliding door would be better with a power option to at least perform the final securing action.\n",
      "It would be useful to be able to remove the seats on the passenger side of the car like the two center rear seats to carry large objects easily.\n",
      "The large vehicles that are often used in town are an ideal application of the technology, and it is sad that nobody is doing it yet.\n",

      "The car handles great, with fab acceleration; good safety features; easy to get used to the electronic display system - there are online tutorials, or the dealer can help set up and answer questions; be careful with the road departure mitigation as it feels like you are losing control of the steering needlessly - turn it off because you already know how to drive safely; the BRAKE BRAKE warning is annoying, but the car has different braking than my old car, so I've gotten used to it; read the owner's manual for quick guide to questions, but some things aren't very clear, like how to shuffle the USB media for music play lists; love the stereo system - so much more advanced than the old car; I like the car seats for comfort BUT I am afraid that I will slide off the seat in a collision and get badly hurt by the seat belt or air bag; definitely get the deep rim rubber all-weather mats; love the gas mileage.\n",

      "But I want a cd player so that I can play my 1,000 cd's while traveling.\n",
      "Also, all the little wheels and buttons that control functions need to be redesigned, and many need to be placed where they can be more easily reached AND used.\n",

      "2b) Required steps for resuming playback after shutting off and turning the vehicle back on are: Navigate to Audio Source screen -> Press Play (I think) -> Press \"Next Song\" (I think) -> Maybe Press Play again?\n",
      "This results in 9 times out of 10, never getting to continue to play the current song.\n",

      "It has allowed many configurations to suit my needs, including over-sized cups and the ability to have a small tissue box hidden in the arm rest.\n",
      "I'd choose a better hands-free setup and use experience over auto-A/C for instance.\n",
      "Safe choice, good reputation, reliable, meets overall family need, economical, service easy to find, maintenance is not a burden, generally good mileage, good value for cars of this size and type, not the most comfortable, luxurious, or high performing, not the car to create a prestige impression.\n",
      "Interior fabric on armrests, console, door interiors, headliner is very thin and a poor choice.\n",
      "My 15-year-old Honda trade-in had better sound quality.\n",

      "FYI: I didn't buy the Civic w/navigation  b/c of higher price, which I did not feel was justified.\n",

      "Jan 28, 2016I love the look, feel, comfort, driveability and gas mileage of my new car, and the selection and leasing experience was enjoyable and satisfactory - however, as this point, within the first month after buying it, i am very disappointed with the connectivity of my 2016 Civic.\n",
      "I was persuaded to buy a car that does not have its own GPS (only comes in the top priced model with features i don't want or need) on the basis that my (fully functional Samsung) smartphone could connect for navigation, etc.\n",
      "The phone disconnects constantly - dropping me out of navigation - while driving, and so far i have had no response at all from the dealer.\n",
      "I think it's hard to clean the floor mats because it holds on to more hair and other debris and yes, I do use a professional grade vacuum for cars.\n",
      "There are some things you could get rid of in order to make room for improving the sound system.\n",
      "For how awesome the Civic is, you should be able to cruise in it and have fun with the music blasting and bumping somewhat.\n",
      "Please change this because listening to the music is one of the most important things you do in the car besides driving it.\n",
      "Whatever you guys use to build the exterior black paneling around the door side windows drives me nuts.\n",
      "I would prefer the black cloth side door rest and middle console made from the same cloth be made with leather even though it's not leather interior at least for my model (EX-T with cloth seats).\n",
      "I would prefer not to have manual seats.\n",

      "It's a safe and reliable care - it's from Honda so it shouldn't have any foreseeable problems.\n",
      "The ride is comfortable, i think more due to the seats than the ride, as it does get a little bumpy at times.\n",
      "The touch screen is nice; however, I'd caution using it or the 'swipe' type of steering wheel control to adjust the volume.\n",
      "Regarding the swipe feature, It's a little bit of a pain when I take a corner or accidentally move my hand on the wheel and the volume blasts up or down.\n",
      "The touchscreen volume increase makes me take my eyes off the road too long to make sure i'm hitting it right - i'm really not comfortable using it.\n",
      "For example, (this may be app specific) but when my fiance' is in the car searching music on the touchscreen it will occasionally tell her that the vehicle screen can no longer scroll because the vehicle is in motion.\n",
      "It's makes sense if there is one person in the car, but the car can carry multiple people - so it's a little annoying when it 'locks up' on a person in the passenger seat.\n",
      "After driving for a few months, I've noticed that it's a little more difficult to get the car to 'play nice' with Android Auto/Android phones.\n",
      "I'm also not used to the CVT transmission, as it is my first of this particular type.\n",

      "The dash features are new and exciting; I LOVE the fact that it integrates so flawlessly with my iPhone.\n",
      "I love the lane-keep assist system (definitely useful during those tense traffic moments when it's hard to know where the lane is) and the break warnings (a not-obnoxious-but-clear beep) have saved my front bumper when people in front of me slam on the brakes.\n",
      "I also really enjoy driving with the automated cruise control which helps to maintain a cushion in front of me and the car in front of me while still maintaining pace.\n",

      "May 25, 2016I was disappointed that my 2016 Civic EX L coupe did not have power seats like the 2016 EX L sedan.\n",

      "The main screen and dash board screen flashed on and off, with no response to touch.\n",
      "--there was no way to control the heating/cooling system, radio, monitor my speed or anything else.\n",
      "Secondly, the fabric used on the arm rest and interior door handles was a poor choice.\n",
      "I have only had my car for a couple months, I clean it regularly, and I can already see the daily use marks on the inside handle from opening and closing the driver door.\n",
      "I do not think the use of fabric on an interior handle that gets so much use (driver and passenger doors) is very practical.\n",
      "One other thing I forgot in the \"I wish my car had this\" section is, I wish it had adjustable lumbar support in the front seats.\n",
      "the \"menu\" used to be WAY more informational and more options, such as average fuel and range with current fuel, maintenance info, door setup, all gone now; trip counter is now manual instead of digital; no valet key; cigarette lighter socket is EXTREMELY difficult (behind this huge panel); smaller cup holders; used to read out text messages if phone was connected, to name a few).\n",
      "After owning an Accord, the Civic is fun to drive and as with all Honda's, it is reliable.\n",
      "As with most new cars, the Civic is loaded with every conceivable computerized, electronic feature ranging from Collision Avoidance to Lane Mitigation.\n",

      "The technology for safety , sound and connectivity is great but requires serious intention to learn so that it can be used easily and not be a distraction while driving.\n",

      "I'm glad there is some dial control for the heat/ac -- but total dial control & dial volume radio control would be a good idea.\n",
      "Using your phone on your car is a necessity these days and Honda is failing with the latest models.\n",
      "I have had all sorts of problems with the vehicle... false maintenance minders for an oil change, false brake and other important item failure warnings for no reason, no audio sound at all (fixed more than once, now), loud popping noises that could easily ruin my speakers, false brake warnings with my brakes slamming without my control and without anything in front of me (impossible to reproduce - just give it a couple of months and it'll happen again)... just... disappointing.\n",
      "Second, was the sound system/nav.\n",
      "The system was reset to alleviate the fact that the radio/navigation sound wouldn't work, and there was a loud gunshot noise coming from the speakers but nothing would play.\n",

      "The Potentiometer Gas Pedal is the WORST part of the car.\n",
      "At very light throttle (at all speeds, but especially low, like 10 MPH) it toggles between OFF & ON and causes the car to deaccelerate/accelerate at a steady, very light pedal press.\n",
      "Since Honda chose to use a Potentiometer Gas Pedal, Honda should have made sure it was COMPLETELY SMOOTH through the ENTIRE range when held at a light throttle press, from 1 MPH to top speed.\n",
      "I had an issue with the feature that allows a double click on the key fob's unlock button to open all the windows and sunroof all the way.\n",

      "The engine power is sufficient.\n",

      "Doors are constantly locked, doesn't unlock when putting in park.\n",

      "(2) Add the option of a bench seat in the front row.\n",
      "You could add the shifter to the column, move the cupholders forward, shrink the driver/passenger seats, etc.\n",
      "I love the LED headlights, it'd be nice to make them like the Acuras', where there are individual lights.\n",
      "The changing of climate controls are a nuisance while driving because you need to look at the monitor instead of having simple buttons.\n",
      "The exterior is superbly styled while the manual engine allows me to enjoy my vehicle on a personal level.\n",
      "The handling makes it ride like sports car, while the sedan 4-door body style allows me to fit 2 car seats and take my 2 toddlers with me.\n",
      "I want a manual transmission, with a moonroof, top end stereo and hatchback.\n",
      "I noticed a dent in the door just below the window after washing it for the first time.\n",
      "Feb 3, 2016Again the Honda Civic being nearly as large as the Accord is one of the best values in a car when you consider safety, features, performance, comfort and style.\n",
      "Also backup/side camera is barely useable when it comes to bad rain weather and snow.\n",
      "Also the climate settings don't stay like I had them when I try to remotely start car.\n",
      "The only thing that I would say I don't like right now is the loud braking system that can be heard on the inside of the car on the driver's side.\n",
      "Apr 28, 2016Honda needs to work more quickly to fix pretty major problems like cvt or power surging at highway speeds, infotainment system errors very often, brake system errors, and brakes grabbing.\n",

      "I have had a few complaints from front seat passengers that their seat is low and difficult to get in and out.\n",
      "The seats are amazing and the IP is pretty cool...though there is no \"real\" noticeable torque steer for an FWD car - it's still FWD and if you're coming from AWD or RWD, it will take time getting used to or (like me) you may never get used to it... Crazy styling but it grows on you and still kinda turns heads - most of them for good reasons...\n",
      "I'm still angry about the third brake light cover.\n",
      "When you put the car in gear and push the gas, the brake releases.\n",

      "The tires that are on the new Honda Civic are Hyundai qualityÃ¢ÂÂnot Honda quality.\n",
      "The car is a great ride but the radio and display technology is very bad.\n",
      "I really wanted to a Civic with the best sound system available and with a satellite radio option, but those options were only available on vehicles with a turbo engine.\n",
      "The biggest issue is control of the audio volume, which I believe would be far better implemented as a simple volume knob as opposed to the touchscreen.\n",
      "Even having the buttons on the steering wheel to control volume are not as convenient as just grabbing and twisting a knob.\n",
      "The vehicle would have received perfect ratings if the sound sync via USB and Bluetooth was perfectly integrated like the one on the 2016 Accord and if it had a CD slot.\n",
      "The final improvement would be the option of adding LED headlights (non-jeweled like the Touring) and mirror side turn signals on EX, EX-T, and EX-L. Jun 25, 2016So far the new 10th generation Honda Civic receives a 9/10 or A-.\n",

      "Driving down the highway I noticed there is a bad wind noise by the drivers door window and I finally determined it is the poor aerodynamics of the rearview mirror on the drivers door  which actually vibrates at highway speed and results in a somewhat blurry image when using this mirror.\n",
      "In addition an emission warning light has been displayed several times on the dash and my local Honda dealer didn't know what it was so they had to give me a loaner car to try and fix it and it turns out it is supposedly just a glitch in the Honda- software that Has to be reprogrammed and even though I've owned the car now for half a year apparently Honda hasn't rushed through any programming changes for this since I have not been alerted that such is available.\n",

      "It's easy to use, it's comfortable, it's reliable, it's safe, and I took the basic design and added a few options to make it reflect my style since I plan to have the car for the foreseeable future (I owned my last Honda CR-V for +12 years!).\n",

      "Best features: large center console screen, Apple Car Play, Honda sensing (lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, 3-angle rear-view camera), lay-flat cargo space, power driver and passenger seats, heated seats, quality fabric and interior finishes, etc.\n",
      "I decided to make the purchase to get the enhanced safety features, but was delightfully surprised by the great handling and ride.\n",
      "Honda has always been a totally dependent brand, but recent issues with the airbags and now this software have diminished my trust level, especially as I have been told there is no fix available at the moment - this is completely unsatisfactory!\n",
      "Great all round car with very good gas mileage versitle and flexible \n",
      "Safety features are very helpful in today's traffic conditions May 7, 2018just one future improvement of the Honda CRV dash, can the fuel gauge be moved inwards on the display, so the hand/steering wheel does not interfere with seeing the analogue display on the left\n",
      "Loud engine noise.\n",
      "Make the gas tank larger and change the color of the gas level indicator so the driver clearly sees it.\n",

      "Does it MISS me?\n",
      "As far as I can tell, HondaLink does NOTHING except prevent me from looking at my phone.\n",
      "OTHER FEEDBACK\n",
      "- The gas tank is WAY too small.\n",
      "Even when I let it get down to 4 miles to go, approx 1/10 gallon, there's really 1 to 1-1/2 gallons left, about 33-47 miles.\n",
      "- The left side blind spot is REALLY BAD.\n",
      "I can't see very much at all out of the left mirror, and have to turn my body around and peer out the left side of my peripheral vision to catch cars in the blind spot.\n",
      "It scrapes some times, either parking, or going through a dip.\n",
      "It was why I bought the Honda instead of a Nissan, Toyota, or Ford.\n",
      "- On the other hand, what the heck is the difference between LKAS (lane keeping assist system) and RDM (road departure mitigation system)?\n",
      "I LOVE the incredible cargo space and ability to drive my friends around with so much spaciousness.\n",
      "The car is quite loud and splashy on the road and suffers from noticeable wind noise.\n",
      "My old 2013 Ford Fiesta (in the same subcompact class) was LIGHT YEARS ahead of the Fit in terms of overall driving refinement.\n",
      "Please, SUPPORT APPLE CARPLAY OR ANDROID AUTO.\n",
      "On top of that, the Fit's front passenger comfort could use some drastic improvement.\n",
      "The lack of soft padding in the left door armrest is embarrassing, and if not for the manual transmission, the center armrest's incredibly low position would be torture.\n",
      "This vehicle gets excellent fuel economy, is very fun to drive, has a unique and fun look, and is surprisingly roomy for its size.\n",
      "It has a good quality stereo system, but lacks cutting-edge sync with smartphones (no Android or Apple CarPlay currently), but the features out-weight the drawbacks.\n",
      "It's also very reliable and has minimal blind-spots.\n",
      "I understand this is a potential safety feature, but the point of having such a great port is to allow hook ups of DVD players, or other tablets to be played on the screen.\n",
      "First, I wish that the software were easier to upgrade to allow for integration with Android Auto.\n",
      "Second, the HDMI port needs to be available for use while driving so that passengers and back-seat passengers can have video entertainment on long trips.\n",
      "I recognize that this was done as a safety feature to prevent distraction from drivers trying to watch video while driving, however, there could be safe guards in place to minimize this from happening, such as disabling HDMI controls from the steering wheel while in drive, as well as lane-monitoring while HDMI in drive is activated to alert the driver if unexpected lane shifts are occurring, and in that case, a fail-safe could disable video until the car is in park again.\n",
      "Other than those three recommendations, I absolutely love the Fit and would recommend it to anyone, especially tall people such as my self (6'3\"), because there is plenty of headroom and comfort.\n",
      "The seats are noticeably uncomfortable.\n",
      "WHY?\n",
      "LOVE the color!\n",
      "Love the sunroof and the tinted windows.\n",
      "I still have very mixed feelings a/b electronic nav screens in cars.\n",
      "Love that the back seats fold up; I've used this for handcarts and other \"tall\" items, since it's easier for me than folding down seats and laying the carts inside.\n",
      "I love that the steering wheel in my Fit reminds me of the Element, as do the various storage options.\n",
      "Basically, the Fit feels like a smaller Element with more traditional doors than the ElementÃ¢ÂÂand that's great!\n",
      "However, I really wish I could have got the sophisticated navigation options WITHOUT getting a sunroof.\n",
      "Sunroofs mean nothing to meÃ¢ÂÂI will never use them, too much weird lighting, and too much HEAT!\n",
      "But I use my iPhone navigation every day, and would love to see the map on the console rather than my phone.\n",
      "I would have paid extra for navigation options, but I DID NOT WANT A SUNROOF!\n",
      "It is not a luxury car by any stretch of the imagination; but is economical and convenient to use from its affordability, maintenance, and gas mileage.\n",
      "The exterior appearance is above average, and I was not really shopping for a luxury automobile in the first place.\n",
      "I am secure with the quality of its performance, durability, and safety.\n",
      "There is always a give and take when it comes to affordability (i.e., A/C power, better quality interior materials, interior design, etc.\n",
      "If it is worth mentioning, this is the only vehicle that I experienced a mildew smell after using the re-circulation vent for a short period of time.\n",
      "Mar 16, 2016The console can be improved regarding connectivity and navigation.\n",
      "I prefer a plain mirror with other options to view blind spots and oncoming traffic.\n",
      "The steering wheel totally blocks the speedometer, I can't believe Honda let that pass!!\n",
      "The dashboard reflects the sun off the interior windshield, making it almost impossible to see while driving, its dangerous!\n",
      "Apr 5, 2016The Honda Fit has a very poor audio system, it does not sync well with Android, its voice recognition system does not work.\n",
      "dashboard has terrible glare on windshield in many conditions, steering wheel totally blocks view of speed indicator on dash.\n",
      "The cargo space is incredible with the seats folded down.\n",
      "We regularly haul lots of equipment and having seats that fold flat is critical, which is a surprisingly hard to find feature.\n",
      "Whoever designed the seats and cargo space for this car should be commended.\n",
      "Although road noise was improved with the 2016, the car is still extremely noisy, and I have found the Bluetooth speakers in all Honda's are garbage.\n",
      "This may simply be the incessant amount of noise from the road, but no one can ever hear you if you are driving down the road.\n",
      "At 75 mph, the engine is at 3750 RPMs and is quite loud.\n",
      "I want a real overdrive gear, something used only for the highway.\n",
      "I want a top gear that drops the RPMs when I am cruising on the highway.\n",
      "As stated on the previous survey I filled out, the driver seat is extremely uncomfortable and gives me back pain on pretty much a daily basis.\n",
      "The gas mileage has not improved over the break-in period and is still well below the EPA estimates for city driving.\n",
      "The acceleration does not seem right to me either, although this is the first new car I've owned in some time, so it's hard to judge (I intend to take the car to a dealership and get the mileage and performance issues checked out).\n",
      "On the plus side, I like the hands-free security and the cameras.\n",
      "Apr 17, 2016The driver's seat is extremely uncomfortable and is causing me back pain.\n",
      "The music interface system is not very good either (too much menu navigation required).\n",
      "But, I love the rear view and passenger side cameras!!\n",
      "Wish you could reduce the road/exterior noise!!!\n",
      "Aug 27, 2016The headlights and fog lights need to be better (brighter, aimed better).\n",
      "Would also be helpful in winter snow storms if the fog lights could work by themselves without the headlights.\n",
      "A little more room between driver and passenger would make the front seats feel better.\n",
      "A longer armrest over the middle console would enable driver and passenger to both rest their arms.\n",
      "There is a lack of comfortable armrests and built-in storage.\n",
      "The seats are comfortable enough that I ALMOST don't miss the armrests.\n",
      "The controls on the steering column do not work in expected ways.\n",
      "It is fun and comfortable to drive, the gas mileage is amazing, and the versatility of the interior configurations is wonderful.\n",
      "Oct 3, 2016I would like to see the controls on the steering column more like they were on my 2002 Odyssey.\n",
      "The steering wheel itself was also more comfortable.\n",
      "After several months I'm still having trouble with the way the steering column controls work (lights, wipers, etc.\n",
      "I wish that the overall seating comfort on all but short drives was better and that road noise at highway speeds were a lot less.\n",
      "I would have liked to have XM radio capabilities for the radio and automatic temperature control for the HVAC system.\n",
      "Jan 27, 2016I bought the vehicle because it fit in my garage next to a larger vehicle, I believe it was a good value, had faith in the reliability of Honda, It had the versatility to accommodate four adults with minimal other storage, but a very good amount of storage while accommodating two adults.\n",
      "I am really enjoying it and feel safe driving my family in it.\n",
      "Interior finishes could be higher quality.\n",
      "The windows rattle unless completely opened or completely closed.\n",
      "However with Hondas reputation, I feel confident that the engine is reliable and will last.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016The problem I experienced after less than three months of ownership was squeezing and creaking of the drivers seat springs.\n",
      "It still squeaks and now the drivers window rattles when it is rolled partially down.\n",
      "The versatility of the back seats was a huge selling point.\n",
      "It is a VERY good commuter vehicle and does very good on gas and is fun to drive.\n",
      "Down sides are minor: front seat legroom is a little short (I am 6' and have just enough), road noise is a little high on interstate and (this is minor).\n",
      "It is fun to drive and get excellent gas mileage.\n",
      "Maybe the only negatives are, it could use just a little more front seat legroom and the front seat does not seem like it is going to hold up.\n",
      "Car is fun to drive and fairly comfortable.\n",
      "Please make the Navigation turn by turn directions audible through the Bluetooth speakers (this only seems to happen if I'm on the phone).\n",
      "Please add a moonroof option to the LX and other colors.\n",
      "Didn't think I'd need it but the rear camera makes parking so much easier!\n",
      "The EX's \"features\" that turned me off were the touchscreen not being responsive and the side mirror cameras which I felt were distracting.\n",
      "The Alloy wheels which also seemed to be targets for theft.\n",
      "I miss not having a \"trunk popper\" (being able to pop the hatchback door when inside the car).\n",
      "I also think the armrest in the middle of the two front seats is useless.\n",
      "I also used to be able to rest my arm on the back of the passenger seat, because in my other cars, the tops of the seats were square.\n",
      "Because these seat tops are more pointed, I cannot do that anymore.\n",
      "I am also still getting used to having the blind spot when I look back when I am reversing.\n",
      "I know I have the rearview camera, but I don't use it.\n",
      "Things seem distorted and much closer than they look on the screen and so I don't use the camera.\n",
      "It's an extremely smooth ride with flexible seating options and space that make the daily commute and camping with a child and dogs comfortable.\n",
      "My only complaint would be the horsepower when starting up from a light, the CVT transmission doesn't have much oomph behind it.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016The only dislike I have with my new vehicle is that the Bluetooth automatically forces my phone to begin playing the first song on my phone, regardless of wether the music app is open or not.\n",
      "I would prefer it prompt me to play music rather than instantly starting.\n",
      "My Fit is great, but the older models had more & better cupholders, while these are great for passengers (you couldn't stash a hot drink in the door as in previous models or behind the center console) and the front cupholders are under the AC, etc., so a larger cup would not fit.\n",
      "My other complaint is for the rear camera.\n",
      "The cupholders aren't as good as previous models (too small, too few, inconvenient), and the technology seems a bit buggy (voice calling acting up, rear camera is distorted).\n",
      "Jul 15, 2016I think the seats could be more comfortable.\n",
      "The material Honda used isn't comfortable against bare skin like when you wear shorts.\n",
      "My father would like more legroom for the passenger, he has no support under his legs and his knees almost hit the dash.\n",
      "I bring my dog most places with me and my favorite part of the Fit is how the back seat folds up and locks so quickly and easily.\n",
      "I have a bed for my dog there and when we ride, he props himself up with his front legs between the front seats and its all very comfortable and fun - I can pet him as we ride, which I love.\n",
      "I also am able to sort of seatbelt him in with a leash hooked to the child safety seat hook.\n",
      "My biggest complaint about the basic-level fit is that I SO wish heated seats were standard, 'cause I live in Minnesota :(((((((.\n",
      "The roof support beam between the door and windshield wider in 2018 Fit compared to 2009 and is obstruction of vision.\n",
      "this has caused blind spot and can't see pedestrians in cross walk unless you look around it.I liked the gas door that was push spring from outside of car.\n",
      "Hate gas handle under dash board as next to hood latch and have opened hood many  times.\n",
      "I love my little Honda!\n",
      "Annoys me more than anything.\n",
      "I put dogs in my car and drive from house to house to take care of pets in their own homes for a living.\n",
      "Apr 15, 2016Wish front angled windows or small rear windows opened, even if manually, to increase airflow without such noise.\n",
      "The Honda Fit is a great little car: fun to drive, easy to park, roomy, and fuel efficient.\n",
      "Good buy, good use of space.\n",
      "I really love the feeling of reliability, and the gas mileage is excellent.\n",
      "Apr 3, 2016It was the Honda Fit Magic seat that really won us over.\n",
      "Vehicle does not have lane warning lights.\n",
      "Fan speed for heating and cooling is too strong even on \"1.\"\n",
      "I like the gas milage and the backup camera.\n",
      "The cargo area is impressive in such a small car and the seats are easy to put down.\n",
      "I do wish that the passenger seat could go further back as I had a 6'1\" friend on vacation with me, and the poor girl spent the whole time with her knees against the glove box.\n",
      "I also would like a kick plate of some kind on the inside of the driver's door as I find myself pushing there to open the door.\n",
      "It is not only stylish and drives smooth, but also has unbeatable fuel efficiency and safety.\n",
      "Jul 4, 2016Rattling noise in ceiling, loud windshield wipers, and no front seat armrests, but I do enjoy the car!\n",
      "More options for interior colors, leather, fabric other than black.\n",
      "More useful drivers armrest, it's too low.\n",
      "Cloth seats stain too easily, even with salt water.\n",
      "Very satisfied with this vehicle except for one important complaint: There is not enough legroom in driver or passenger seat.\n",
      "Seats need to go back four more inches for me ( 6\"0\" tall).\n",
      "There seems to be plenty of extra legroom in back seat, so I don't know why you stop the rear travel of the front seats so soon.\n",
      "Great interior space, fun enough to drive, relatively comfortable for its class.\n",
      "Make it so the front seats can be adjusted backwards further.\n",
      "There's tons of room in the back seats for it.\n",
      "Apr 27, 2016I wonder why they put so much emphasis on back seat legroom when the front seats are the ones that are occupied more often and have less space.\n",
      "Aug 7, 2016Missing USB plug and air vents in second row seating.\n",
      "Also missing cupholders in section seating.\n",

      "Heating and cooling are fair.\n",
      "A lot better gas mileage than the Jeep I used to own.\n",
      "A lot more safety features than my Jeep had.\n",
      "The back-up and right-turn camera are nice features as well as the windows are easier for me to see out of.\n",
      "The Fit is an excellent econobox with a lot of passenger room, a hatchback with a back seat that goes flat to carry large loads.\n",
      "Feb 2, 2016I really like the Fit, it gets great milage and is comfortable to ride/drive.\n",
      "It looks cool, it's very roomy on the inside for how small it is, it gets great gas mileage, and it's fun to drive.\n",
      "My favorite things about my older Scion xB were it's uniqueness, interior versatility, and good gas mileage.\n",
      "The release for the fuel tank requires the arm length of a gorilla.\n",
      "It suits my needs, is comfortable on longer trips, and gets good gas mileage.\n",
      "So far, I only have two issues: (1) when I went through a car wash with undercarriage wash, water got into the spare tire hold; and (2) when I roll down only one of the back windows, the entire car shakes and shudders.\n",
      "Jun 19, 2016Concerned about overall strength of suspension and durability of wheels/tires for handling the infamous potholes of Chicago.\n",
      "Love the Honda Fit except for the road and engine noise.\n",
      "Not so good at carrying passengers and cargo--if you can't fold down the seats, you can't carry anything large.\n",
      "We bought a new model Fit because the seats were redesigned and are more comfortable, especially for my husband (he's 6'4\" and losing flexibility as he gets older).\n",
      "The rear seat head pieces and the the small back window frames interfere with your vision when you need to look to your right before pulling into traffic.\n",
      "You should have a control for the power locks on the passenger side.\n",
      "Mar 29, 2016Having a 5-speed 2011 Fit, I wish 6th gear were higher to improve mileage and reduce engine noise.\n",
      "The cupholder design is AWFUL - the ones in front of the gearshift are inaccessible, the one to the left of the steering wheel is difficult to access while driving/blocks the air vent.\n",
      "It's reliable, good on gas, plenty of storage space, easy to park.\n",
      "It's very functional; rear seats are easy to move up and down.\n",
      "I like the style of the car, the safety features and the car is fun to drive.\n",
      "The Honda Fit is zippy, fun to drive, and is versatile with the \"magic\" backseat configurations.\n",

      "Two things I wish it had: more cup space and an auxiliary jack as not everything is Bluetooth compatible.\n",
      "Because I have dogs and because the seats are a black cloth-like material, I find it difficult to keep the seats clean.\n",
      "The headlights definitely do not illuminate far enough ahead of where you drive.\n",
      "I enjoy driving my new Honda Fit, I feel safe in this vehicle.\n",
      "The cups holders are too small in the console below the navigation.\n",
      "It is annoying that the stereo doesn't go back to the FM radio.\n",
      "It is comfortable and handles well.\n",
      "With the seats down, there is room for quite a bit of luggages or baggage.\n",
      "Lack of power seat controls is unusual.\n",
      "Lack of interior button/lever to open rear hatch is extremely frustrating.\n",
      "I love the driver's seat: I can raise it.\n",
      "I am short, and this seat is great because I have an easier time gauging distances in front of me.\n",
      "The only thing I don't like is that I can't listen to the radio when I turn the engine off unless I leave it in gear when I am parked.\n",
      "The one thing I dislike about the 2018 Fit Sport is that being a short person, I have a bit of a hard time reaching the gas pedal comfortably.\n",
      "My old Elantra's seat tilted forward which helped this immensely.\n",
      "The car itself is expertly made, but some additional safety features (parking sensors that beep) should be standard if a rear camera is standard.\n",
      "Practical, economical, fun to drive, very good quality, reliable, roomy for its overall size.\n",
      "I enjoy driving it if you say I love going faraway and mileage.\n",
      "Apr 4, 2016i love the interior and the exterior.\n",
      "I bought my second Honda Fit, because it gets excellent gas mileage but also allows for comfort.\n",
      "I love them because of reliability and confidence in their performance thru the years!\n",
      "It's safe, gets great mileage, and I love how the rims look!\n",
      "Lighter interior colors for desert areas would be a bonus.\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016Please improve the rear backup camera.\n",
      "Fit should have programmable door unlock capabilities.\n",
      "Lots of cargo room and spaciousness  when folding down rear seats.\n",
      "Handles great, great gas mileage,,and more interior space then you would expect.\n",
      "Loud road noise insideÃ¢ÂÂonly thing wrong with it.\n",
      "So far I have found my Fit to be reliable and fuel efficient.\n",
      "There should be a left-side blindspot camera.\n",
      "Configure the seats to carry larger items.\n",
      "Good gas mileage, plenty interior space, sporty, easy to park.\n",
      "Seats very uncomfortable, memory stick won't work.\n",

      "Easy to drive, fits easily into small parking spaces and narrow streets.\n",
      "The driver's seat does not go back far enough.\n",
      "Apr 15, 2016Would like the ability to move driver's seat further back.\n",
      "It is easy to maneuver and fun to drive, but could benefit from a little more power.\n",
      "Although the engine is not powerful, the paddle-shifters help compensate for this, and it returns excellent fuel economy as advertised.\n",
      "The HR-V has proven to handle snowy, winter weather very well in the Eastern mountains, where we can have rapidly changing conditions.\n",
      "The EX trim HR-V has many upscale, electronic features for it's price and the standard wheels/ tires are excellent.\n",
      "The drivers seating area has a sporty, almost cockpit like feel, which some may enjoy but those who are used to more spacious interiors may feel claustrophobic at first.\n",
      "Their is a fair amount of road noise and engine noise, which Honda could likely handle with a little more insulation, but the car feels very stable on the highway.\n",
      "In spite of its limited power, the HR-V has a fun to drive quality, seems reliable, and is definitely fuel efficient.\n",
      "This vehicle should satisfy most drivers needs, except for those who require powerful acceleration or haul heavy loads.\n",
      "Jul 17, 2016Negatives I have encountered:\n",
      "-The handling on the HR-V is excellent, but the inability to pair the manual transmission with a sunroof greatly diminishes the driving enjoyment for the EX.\n",
      "The engine sounds \"tinny,\" not very pleasant or reassuring.\n",
      "(The Elements engine even sounded better) \n",
      "-The paddle-shifters do not add to driving enjoyment for me, but they do help to compensate for low power when merging; again, I would prefer a manual transmission.\n",
      "-The fabric material on the upper doors is out of place and looks ready to stain or catch on something and rip; even plastic would be better.\n",
      "-The drivers seat seems to cut into the back of my thighs, and I have noticed some back discomfort on longer trips.\n",
      "-The audio and climate controls on the touchscreen are slow to respond at times and can be a distraction.\n",
      "-The lane-watch camera is handy for right turns, but why not have it for left turns as well?\n",
      "-The road handling and steering on the HR-V are phenomenal for a crossover.\n",
      "-The styling of the rear 3/4s of the HR-V is great and the rear/taillights are perfect.\n",
      "-The heated seats are great.\n",
      "This does allow me overlook engine noise and lack of power somewhat\n",
      "-The aluminum wheel rims that come standard are sporty without being tacky.\n",
      "(Perfect)\n",
      "-Visual Styling of interior, other than upper door sills, is great.\n",
      "-Audio controls on steering wheel are useful.\n",
      "-Storage space in the rear and folding seats are great for someone with stuff to haul.\n",
      "The cloth door trim and seat trim (LX and EX models) seem like they may not be durable.\n",
      "The interior controls on the HR-V should use knobs rather than a touchscreen for most of the controls.\n",
      "I question the longterm reliability of touch controls and the CVT (Transmission).\n",
      "The HR-V should get better gas mileage considering its lethargic acceleration.\n",
      "While it gets decent fuel economy, the exterior is fun looking, and the interior is very flexible for cargo handling options, it's not a comfortable or enjoyable driving experience.\n",
      "The road noise is loud, the touchscreens are annoying and dangerous (as you have to take your eyes off the road to adjust something as simple as the fan speed), the seats force a back curve.\n",
      "Get rid of the forced curve to the back of the seat so we can sit straight and improve the cargo cover.\n",
      "If the seats were more comfortable for long drives.\n",
      "The CR-V has more optionsÃ¢ÂÂpower seats, HomeLinkÃ¢ÂÂthat the HR-V doesn't have.\n",
      "I no longer need the larger cargo size of the CR-V, but I still want the comforts!\n",
      "While the heated seats are nice (not needed, but kind of nice), the lack of electronic controls is weird.\n",
      "The touch-sensitive dash can be annoying.\n",
      "A HUGE problem with my HR-V is the lack of proper storage.\n",
      "Where the heck am I supposed to keep my sunglasses and remote control for the garage door (since you don't offer HomeLink)?\n",
      "The only thing my CR-V didn't have was the HomeLink, and I'd planned on getting it for my next vehicle.\n",
      "I couldn't believe i got a crappy navigation system (my Garmin is miles better) and Sirius radio (that I couldn't care less about) instead of something that would really be useful.\n",
      "The down side after driving it now for awhile are that the seats are extremely uncomfortable after more than 3-4 hours of driving.\n",
      "The driver seat does not have the ability to customize the angles enough to get pressure off your butt.\n",
      "I have had to use my phone for navigation instead as many times it steered me wrong or I was unable to program the location (not found in the GPS).\n",
      "The ports for plugging things in are in a really awkward space which wouldn't be much of a problem except I need to use my phone for navi because Honda's nav system is so bad.\n",
      "And it won't allow me to use my nav on my phone through the Bluetooth.\n",
      "I have to crack the windows to help with the heat build up when parked and cracking the windows helps with closing the doors which tend to not close fully when all the windows are up.\n",
      "Only recommendation is more choice of colors and interior/exterior combinations.\n",
      "Doors do not shut wellÃ¢ÂÂhave to close them vigorously, and the headlights stay on if you don't close them all the way.\n",
      "No place to clip a cargo net in the rear storage area.\n",
      "If you are looking for a higher mileage, FWD vehicle that is easy to get in and out of,  fairly simple to use without a ton of technology in it, the Honda HRV FWD is a good buy.\n",
      "Sep 18, 2018The textiles used for the interior doors and seat are pretty bad and show hand prints easily and are rough to sit on.\n",
      "I'm cleaning the doors all the time.\n",
      "Why didn't you keep the hatch release from the remote/FOB; that was a super-convenient feature   Every other Honda I've had (civic & accord) did that.\n",
      "Alloy wheel design and size was not thought out at all.\n",
      "I've NEVER scratched the wheels up as much as I have with this model.\n",
      "The platform that the seat are on is obtrusive for my left foot; there is not comfortable place to put my foot.\n",
      "Poor storage options in-doors, glove box and console.\n",
      "Need to add to or improve front driver passenger storage including better door bottle/cupholder.\n",
      "Need storage pocket on the back of the driver's seat like the one on the back of the front passenger seat.\n",
      "Side mirrors and interior mirror hard to adjust to get full rear view.\n",
      "It would be great if the hump in the middle of the rear seating floor could be eliminated.\n",
      "Love the flexibility of having full flat floor in back with seat backs down and the alternative of having rear seats up for carrying higher items.\n",
      "Rear seat head rests are not adjustable and create serious blind spots for the driver.\n",
      "May 25, 2016Would like to have the following: a pocket on the back of the driver's seat, armrest for driver, better way to adjust distance from driver to steering wheel: I am tall, have a long torso, somewhat shorter arms, and have a hard time finding a comfortable steering position.\n",
      "If you want safety, comfort, reliability, security, dependability, fun, good lines, and a vehicle responsive to your driving need/habits, then buy or lease a Honda!\n",
      "I love the way the seats fold every which way so I can easily load a wide variety of items that follow me from the store to my home!\n",
      "Work on improving the seat belts, older people (my parents) have trouble finding them, fastening and unfastening them.\n",
      "You have to turn on the blower full blast to feel any cooling or heat.\n",
      "Blower is loud so then have to turn it down to hear the phone or anyone talking.\n",
      "I do however love the fact that I can answer my Iphone while driving and have a conversation without having to hold the phone.\n",
      "I have 6 older kids and never know when they will call me, so if I am out driving, I can still take the call by just pressing my button on the steering wheel.\n",
      "Cloth doors?!!!\n",
      "I want a recall for the fabric doors.\n",
      "No fabric on doors.\n",
      "Should have at least two USBs!!!\n",
      "Like the funky green color-brighter would have been better.\n",
      "Love the tall seat feature-I use it every day!!!\n",
      "will try\n",
      "2. lack of the power seat due to the design of magic seats and fuel tank does not allow for tweaking of perfect seating position.\n",
      "Feb 29, 2016I like this HR-V although the seats, which had a detailed question on this survey, are one of my two least favorite issues with the car.\n",
      "I wish their was a power seat option with more adjustments for the highest end model i purchased.\n",
      "The inability to power lift the front and drop the rear of the seat makes getting the \"perfect seating position\" in this car impossible for my 6'1\" frame.\n",
      "Lots of road noise, seats aren't very adjustable, and not as comfortable as my truck.\n",
      "The driver has steering wheel controls.\n",
      "Apr 27, 2016There's a rattle coming from somewhere on the passenger door area, and until we can locate it, we feel that it's no use to bring it in due to most service departments will not acknowledge the rattle since it is intermittent and difficult to recreate all the time.\n",
      "Mar 5, 2016Wish the seats were also ventilated, and there was an option for a heated steering wheel.\n",
      "Also with the seats, with there was an adjustable lumbar support.\n",
      "Road noise is quite loud.\n",
      "I like the simplicity and functionality of the controls for heat/air, as well as the Blue tooth interactive features with my iPhone.\n",
      "I would have added custom options, like a sunroof or heated seats if I did not have to move up to a higher trim level, which featured much more complex controls for heat/air and Blue tooth.\n",
      "I would have purchased the sunroof and heated seat options if they were available as individual choices and not part of the EX package.\n",
      "Needs center 2nd row built-in center armrest with cup holders like other models.\n",
      "Cannot use 2nd row power outlet & cupholder at same time.\n",
      "Very disappointed there is no power driver seat on EXL package.\n",
      "Needs better carpet, 2nd row recessed built in armrest with cupholders, cannot use outlet & cupholder in 2nd row at same time, better access to outlets under dash on floor, needs power drivers seat in EXL package.\n",
      "Jul 24, 2016EXL Needs: better carpet, integrated rear cup holders in armrest, power driver seat adjustment, more rear seat air control, tailgate control button, better access to usb/power/hdmi.\n",
      "1) I liked the blind spot detector on the rearview mirror as it was with a Honda Odyssey I owned.\n",
      "In this car the blind spot flashes up on the computer screen and my eyes have to go three places before switching lanes (the rearview mirror, over my shoulder AND the computer screen).\n",
      "2) The rearview camera is very very cloudy when it is dark and that is when you need it most.\n",
      "The camera on my Honda Odyssey was crystal clear at night.\n",
      "Regardless, it made the camera completely useless at night.\n",
      "3) I brought in the car for service because two outlets that are USB-type outlets were not charging my phone.\n",
      "I was told they are only to feed data on the screen and cannot be used to charge a phone.\n",
      "There is only one phone charging USB port.\n",
      "Even a passenger cannot set the GPS due to this feature that tries to prevent drivers from setting the GPS while driving.\n",
      "However, I love the fold-down split seat and the fold-up back seat.\n",
      "My mother's walker fits right behind the passenger seat.\n",
      "Love the rear seat that folds up for extra space.\n",
      "Added camera view is excellent.\n",
      "Interior and exterior looks great.\n",
      "Apr 15, 2016Would have liked a cargo cover and right side passenger storage box to have a key lock considering the money that was paid for the car.\n",
      "I still love the car, but it is not as fuel-efficient as the Fit by a long shot, and does not have the headroom of a CR-V.\n",
      "Nor is the car capable of towing - a HUGE disappointment, since I wanted to tow a light trailer.\n",
      "Three things:\n",
      "1) Make front and passenger seats power assisted and COMFORTABLE.\n",
      "3) Inculde power lift gate and turn assist on both side of the car.\n",
      "Feb 3, 2016I love my new HR-V. A few things: It would be great to have the option of a power lift gate.\n",
      "When you pay extra for leather in in EXL, the seat should be an 8- or 10-way powered seat, and comfortable.\n",
      "Love the right side blind spot camera, but it should be on both sides.\n",
      "Major safety feature!\n",
      "Test drive first and make sure it's roomy enough for you and your family, and has enough storage space.\n",
      "The charger and storage under the gear shift is just wrong (really bad, tight spot).\n",
      "No storage behind the driver's seat.\n",
      "Apr 6, 2016I like my vehicle, but there are three things I really hate: (1) the mini console - you really can't put anything in it, (2) the vehicles is too loud to be new - it's sounds like the engine is always idled, and (3) there is not any compartments organizers behind the driver's seat.\n",
      "With the engine being so loud, I'm afraid of what it will sound like in a year or two.\n",
      "The doors of this car are perplexing.\n",
      "The handle placement on the outside of the rear doors is nearly too high for my youngest child to reach and are not intuitive at all.\n",
      "The inside of the door panels is already ridiculously dirty because the panels are too high and made of cloth rather than plastic or leather or faux-wood.\n",
      "Otherwise, this is a fabulous car with loads of room and great gas mileage.\n",
      "I use for commuting but then picking up kids at activities after school...some with very large equipment pieces that need a great deal of space.\n",
      "Buy the upgraded version with the better interior materials and sound system.\n",
      "The cheesy fabric door covering is not made to last and gives the car a very cheap feel.\n",
      "I am a skinny person and the seats feel very narrow and the seat belts are difficult to engage.\n",
      "Door panel material is a joke and obviously will not last.\n",
      "Apr 2, 2016The engine noise is too loud in the interior.\n",
      "There should have been a sound barrier or more insulation between the engine and the interior incorporated in the design.\n",
      "I am lucky I do mainly city driving because when on the interstate at 70-80 MPH- the engine sounds like it needs a seventh gear even though the RPM's are at a good level 3-4 thousand.\n",
      "Less headroom than I expected and overall smaller than I realized when test driving.\n",
      "Wipers are very noisy, When sunroof is open, there is a full reflection of the sky in the HondaLink screen making it difficult to see.\n",
      "Mar 3, 2016There are two dissatisfactions that I have noticed: one is the windshield wipers are very loud, and the other is the audio screen is tilted in a manner that if the sunroof is open or the sunroof window adjusted to allow in light, it reflects on the audio screen making it difficult to see.\n",
      "Still wondering if the CR-V is a better vehicle for me for comfort, space, and mileage.\n",
      "The driver's seat is manual.\n",
      "There is no pocket on the back of the driver's seat.\n",
      "It lacks features and quality.\n",
      "Ex: The moonroof cover is cheap.\n",
      "There is no pocket on the back of the driver seat.\n",
      "I do like the AWD and hope the mileage improves with the weather.\n",
      "It is a good vehicle with good mileage for it's size, and is versatile and handles well.\n",
      "It is not top of the line and lacks in some areas of comfort and quality.\n",
      "Fuel-efficient, gas tank too small, average power, easy to drive,  don't really like the rear passenger door handles, cute style, AWD is good, Bluetooth phone is good, voice to text through Bluetooth is really bad.\n",
      "If the door is all the way open, it's a long stretch for a short person to try to close the door.\n",
      "I would like a little more engine power and I need a BIGGER gas tank!\n",
      "This is a great riding vehicle with lots of safety features.\n",
      "As much as I love this vehicle, the one feature that I hate is the fact that the trunk door is so heavy and has no push-button control anywhere.\n",
      "Sep 18, 2016It would be nice to have a trunk-button on door or somewhere for easier access to trunk.\n",
      "Trunk door is very heavy, especially if I have something in my hands or arms (a child for instance).\n",
      "The storage compartment between the passenger and driver seat is way too little.\n",
      "Vehicle should have a button to open the trunk from inside.\n",
      "Easy to handle, like the side view camera, dislike the navigation, needs more storage spaces (no place for things like glasses, no pockets, very small compartment between seats).\n",
      "and have the navigation say the name of the street/road it wants you to turn on - don't want to have to look at the screen while driving - that is why I paid extra to have the higher priced model and then found out it doesn't work as expected.\n",
      "My disappointments with the vehicle are: 1) very poor pick up and slow to accelerate (I went from a BMW to this and was not ready for the loss of power and control); 2) steering is too sensitive and I feel like I have no control over the vehicle; 3) sound system is not very good; 4) AC not as quick and responsive as I would like; 4) touch instrument panel is difficult to reach and control (add that to overly sensitive steering and you have safety issues at high speeds); 5) giving up so much in power and performance, I would expect much better gas mileage than I am getting.\n",
      "I just wish it had electric seat adjustments, at least for the driver's seat....I have the top of the line model and still no power seats.\n",
      "Many functions are unusable while driving, even if the passenger is the one operating the navigation systemÃ¢ÂÂvery frustrating.\n",
      "How can it be that there are not power seats on the top of the line model HR-V??\n",
      "I got tired of waiting for the 1.5 turbo engine, but also felt this model has been tweaked for 4 years which is realized in fit, finish, and quality.\n",
      "Color availability with exterior/interior choices is sparse!\n",
      "It's a good thing the gray interior (the only choice other than black with a few exterior colors) doesn't look too gray.\n",
      "It's fun to drive, attracts attention, great on gas mileage and very comfortable and sporty.\n",
      "Love to drive it.....love the fuel economy.\n",
      "I wish the driver's armrest was more comfortable....I have to use a pillow to support my right arm.\n",
      "Wish the cupholder and console were better designed....the console is useless....not big enough to hold anything, so I keep a bin in the passenger seat to hold essential items like hand sanitizer,  tissues, hand cream, chargers, etc.\n",
      "Wish there was a holder for my cellphone...I wouldn't think it would be much trouble to add a holder.\n",
      "I love the reliability, performance and reputation of a Honda.\n",
      "It was a GREAT feature that I used very often.\n",
      "Does not take long for car to warm up; excellent a/c, heater, auto lights.\n",
      "I would love to see more safety warnings (i.e., lane departure warning) and auto stop when the vehicle senses potential frontal obstruction, potential rear obstruction, or oncoming traffic when backing up (i.e., another vehicle or person approaching).\n",
      "Would love to be able to have an electric tailgate option, as the door can be difficult to open and close when your hands are full.\n",
      "Would also like to see additional safety warnings (i.e., lane departure, etc).\n",
      "I'm happy with the vehicle for the most part, although I have major issues with the bluetooth/music connectivity to my iPhone.\n",
      "I hate the way it automatically plays the first alphabetical song in my music list every time I get in the car.\n",
      "Also, I wish I had opted for leather seats because the cloth seats and interior doors feel very cheap to me.\n",
      "But the leather seats came only with navigation for an additional $2,000, which seemed ridiculous to me.\n",
      "If you have an Android phone, the audio system won't be compatible, and don't add the auto start.\n",
      "It makes no sense to have two keys, and for the feature to cut off once the door is open.\n",
      "I have to clean it everyday because it shows my fingerprints when I touch the interior material.\n",
      "I really wish I would have gotten leather seats.\n",
      "Driver's seat needs to be able to go a little further back.\n",
      "The back seat seatbelts would be better if the shoulder strap location could be lowered to accommodate older children.\n",
      "The touchscreen is awesome, I wish you could customize the screen to show multiple functions, such as both the fuel remaining info and the music info.\n",
      "Why no turn camera on the left side?\n",
      "It drives and handles well, and I find it to be comfortable to drive, which being only 5 feet tall, sometimes I struggle finding cars that don't make me feel like I'm drowning when I try to sit in them.\n",
      "I wish the navigation system was a bit better and there was an actual armrest, but those are minor things.\n",
      "The car was slightly more than I wanted to spend, but I went for it because I wanted a good, safe, and reliable vehicle.\n",
      "The only thing I would change is with the higher trim levels make a cargo cover and armrest included.\n",
      "The major issue is the comfort of the front seats.\n",
      "I have the most expensive trim package and it does not have lumbar support of power seats.\n",
      "The seats are stiff as boards when new.\n",
      "The seats did become softer over time (leather), but with no power adjustment and lumber control, it is a problem.\n",
      "It takes too many buttons to zoom and un-zoom the navigation screen, which is a safety hazard when driving.\n",
      "Feb 4, 2016The front seats where overly stiff and uncomfortable when new.\n",
      "Front seats need lumbar support.\n",
      "The center console needs to be re-worked so there is a flat space between seats - similar to the CR-V from a couple of years ago with the sliding door over the console.\n",
      "Lose touchscreen for volume controls on the center console - the volume/tuning buttons on the steering wheel are a life saver.\n",
      "The Bluetooth/call through the car buttons on the steering wheel are not intuitive, and voice command is frustratingly useless.\n",
      "My issues are: minimal interior storage; weird placement of power jacks; feels underpowered; surprised that no power driver's seat is available; steering is sluggish; difficult line of vision regarding the car in lanes, being straight in a lane, etc.\n",
      "The audio does not have a very rich quality.\n",
      "The touchscreen controls are very difficult to use while driving, as they take too much attention.\n",
      "Love my HRV, looks good, drives so well, room for passengers is great.\n",
      "Great gas mileage--all except center console,  want knobs and buttons back not just touchscreen--it is annoying!\n",
      "I hate spending money on gas, and the HRV gives me the room I need, the features I want, and a great look, and I still get great gas mileage.\n",

      "Downsides are poor fuel economy in this day and age (though not bad for such a heavy vehicle), very wide so parking can be more of a hassle over a smaller car, fairly high cargo load height, and the rear doors don't open as wide as I wish they would but are functional.\n",
      "The rear doors should open another 5-10 degrees more than they do.\n",

      "I can't tell you how many times i get in the car and accidentally hit the emergency brake pedal with my left foot, releasing it - and suddenly it's like another emergency where my car is rolling down a hill.\n",
      "And this is because the only way to put the car in accessory mode after the engine is on so i can listen to my radio, or stay on a phone call over the car's bluetooth is to leave the car in drive or neutral, press down once on the emergency brake, and then press the big stupid big red button.\n",

      "I also don't like the fact that the driver side seatbelt is not as long as in the 2012 Pilot.\n",

      "I would like to have had an option to buy a memory driver seat with the same trim level that I got.\n",
      "Two things I don't like are: (1) the positioning of the fan control buttons for heat/a/c motor.\n",
      "My previous vehicle had that switch in steering wheel, a much better design.\n",
      "), and (2) the driver mirror needs a better convex to provide a better view to that side, to eliminate the blind spot.\n",
      "One is having the heater/fan controls on the steering wheel.\n",
      "The other is a memory driver seat.\n",
      "The interior plastic looks out of fit or place with the upgraded leather seats.\n",
      "The sound system controls on the steering wheel are not great--you can't use them to scan or seek through the radio other than pre-sets and the up/down control for volume doesn't work quickly like a toggle or a wheel would offer.\n",
      "The sound on the sound system is tinny, like lots of systems today: dumbed-down sound inferior to CD players from 10-15 year ago but, hey, the convenience of streaming (sarcasm).\n",

      "\n",
      "1) The touchscreen on the 2016 Pilot is difficult to use, which is distracting for the driver.\n",
      "2) The 2016 Pilot needs more air conditioning vents for rear passengers\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The collision sensor on the 2016 Pilot over-reacts on curves, which then causes the driver to ignore it when it really counts\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The horn on the 2016 Pilot is a little wimpy\n",
      "\n",
      "5) I'd prefer a traditional gearshift to the push-button shifting system.\n",
      "It lacks features, is not intuitive, and the touchscreen is slow to response and poses a safety hazard given the amount of time the driver must spend interacting with it.\n",
      "I absolutely \"hate\" the infotainment system, which in my opinion is third rate, bulky, poorly designed, slow to respond, inaccurate, and frustrating to use.\n",
      "I find it actually \"dangerous\" in terms of the amount of time one must interact with the touchscreen as opposed to using a robust voice command system.\n",
      "The cruise control is frustrating because it is very sensitive to another car pulling in front of you and will over brake (in my opinion) to regain a safe distance.\n",
      "The over braking is killing mileage and possibly could cause a car following you to almost have an accident trying to avoid the over braking applied by the cruise control.\n",

      "Tailgate: omg I could have a birthday in the amount of time it takes the automatic tailgate to go up or down, holyslowly.\n",
      "Give me the reverse camera already!\n",
      "Consider making the seat warmer button a button that must be pushed down and then turned to engage because there have been numerous times I have accidentally turned it on and Well, I live in Hawaii, need I say more?\n",
      "So the bad news is there is something in the dash that is rattling and I need to take it into the shop to have it figured out but I fear that really, taking my dash apart is really only going to create bad problems, so I turn on the crappy radio but that sounds worse than the rattling, so I get irritated.\n",
      "This is a luxury vehicle and should not be rattling at 4 months old.\n",
      "Moving on: There is a slight hill exiting our neighborhood and I cannot remember how many gears my car has but it wants to go through all of them to get up the hill UNLESS I just gas it, so I have learned to just gas it, which seems a bit over the top but so be it.\n",
      "My 2010 Ford seemed to just know how to accelerate up the hill but this lugs unless I give it a ton of gas, like it slugs itself along and almost downshifts, maybe?\n",
      "Back row, for ex: I once tried to lower the back seat to put the dog in the very very back and yeah that did not go so well and hopefully I won't have to do that again before the next 2.5 years is up.\n",
      "I do get a lot of compliments on this car, I do love the paint color, but I have to say I'd prefer to drive my hub's Ford F-150.\n",
      "Love the safety features on my QX60, and these features should be standard.\n",
      "This is why I chose this car: (1) Perfect crossover balance (big enough for third row seating/cargo but still drives like a car, not a truck).\n",
      "(2) Has all the latest safety features designed for collision avoidance.\n",
      "Best crossover on the market, IMHO, with the versatility of an SUV, but drives like a sedan with all of the latest safety features and looks great, too.\n",
      "Things that would make this car even better: better gas mileage (engine off on stop, possibly?\n",
      "), chrome wheels should be offered standard or as affordable option, more and bigger interior storage compartments, navigation should be equipped with real time traffic info like Google apps, higher resolution backup camera, Hold function on brake while stopped.\n",
      "Things I don't like: the pricing structure: most desirable optional features are wood trim and all the safety options (collision avoidance/collision intervention).\n",
      "This would truly be a luxury vehicle if these features were made standard.\n",
      "Don't like that I was forced to add every available option package just to get wood trim and all the safety features that I wanted.\n",
      "I have to hit play on my iPhone then plug it into the USB outlet then hit play again right away or it can't find the song unless its in my playlists.\n",
      "The steering column controls paired with the front seat comfort options make for a very enjoyable ride.\n",
      "An automatic trip reset on the info display would be helpful rather than a continuous running time.\n",
      "On the Interior look of this survey I wanted to note that although I do love most of the interior on the QX60, it still lacks the \"finishing touches\" of a luxury car.\n",
      "Such as the cover up of the areas behind/above gas pedal/brake, etc.\n",
      "I hate that when I clean the car and look under steering wheel at break pedal, I can see the inner workings of the car above the carpet/floor mats.\n",
      "I believe that the cupholders in the center console should be wrapped in a rubber-like material so that the water bottles and drinking cups don't rattle when driving, and a fold down cup bracket should be installed to hold cups and bottles securely in place when driving.\n",
      "The padding on the drivers door, below the window, should have some sort of rebound material so when one removes their elbow from it there won't be a dimple in it from the point of the elbow.\n",
      "The HomeLink buttons should be move from the mirror to the over head console, easier to reach up, and push the button than to reach out to get to it.\n",
      "Aug 7, 2016With the lighter interior, when driving during a sunny day, there is a reflection of the dash and chrome air vent on the drivers window when you are going to use the sideview mirror, you must look through the reflection to read the mirror.\n",
      "The rubber door stops on the rear hatch comes off easily when you are wiping down the door jamb and hatch.\n",
      "In the console cupholder, there should be a rubberized base and upper arms so the water bottles don't rattle when driving.\n",
      "Some of the safety features like blind-spot notification do not work as well as they should.\n",
      "You should not have to push a button each time you drive to turn on safety features.\n",
      "The doors need to be tightened or something.\n",
      "Do not like having to push the door button to unlock the vehicle.\n",
      "Should just be able to grab handle to unlock like most other vehicles.\n",
      "Do not like that there is no door unlock buttons on the rear doors.\n",
      "Some of the safety features like blind-spot notification do not work as well as they should.\n",
      "You should not have to push a button each time you drive to turn on safety features.\n",

      "Do not like having to push door button to unlock the vehicle.\n",
      "Should just be able to grab handle to unlock like most other vehicles.\n",
      "Do not like that there are no door unlock buttons on the rear doors.\n",
      "Looking in the side rear view mirrors I see traffic etc., I see the AC vent and other parts of the dash as a reflection in the mirror.\n",
      "It really makes me question what I am seeing and whether to pull out, change lanes etc.\n",
      "I do have a very large problem with the side and even sometimes front window view.\n",
      "When looking in the side rearview mirrors you see the image of the air conditioning vents and other parts of the interior.\n",
      "Even on the front window, you can see the glare/image of the dash in the window.\n",
      "I have to look through at least one image when looking into my mirrors and sometimes front window.\n",
      "It rides very nice and has a lot of space with the third row of seats.\n",
      "What we like the most is the ease of access to the third row, the comfort of the ride, the power of the engine and drive train.\n",
      "Most of the controls are in a good location for accessing volume, heating/cooling and other amenities in the car.\n",
      "Areas for improvement are adding Car Play, USB connection in the front (not in console), two front air vents cannot be closed, Home Link location should not be on mirror, and larger side water bottle holders.\n",
      "The safety features for the vehicle are very hi tech.\n",
      "The dashboard is too busy make it digital or figure out a way to unclutter all the buttons.\n",
      "Simple things like climate control or navigation are hard.\n",
      "I would like to use google maps sometimes if not always.\n",
      "The music, nav and climate control have no intuitive feel for me.\n",
      "I love the blind spot detection but I feel the indicator light is not bright enough during the daytime.\n",
      "I would like the ability to touch the door handle to unlock the car, and I think the driver's seat should be way more cushioned, softer and more comfortable.\n",
      "The front seat should move farther back to make it easier to exit the car, and the side mirrors should fold automatically.\n",
      "Sep 27, 2016Here were the five (actually 6) items my wife is particularly frustrated about the Infiniti:\r\n",
      "1 - No clothes bar holders\r\n",
      "2 - Inability to shut off the driver center ac/heat vent\r\n",
      "3 - Removed second row headrests for better visibility\r\n",
      "4 - Garage door buttons are not lit on the rearview mirror (we have three garage doors, we end up turning on the lights to find the right one\r\n",
      "5 - Rear license plate flaps at highway speeds\r\n",
      "6 - When the info system is off, it appears all we see is the MAP or watch STATUS.\n",
      "2) The garage door buttons in the rearview mirror are not lit at night, and we find it difficult to hit the right garage door button.\n",
      "3) The drivers side left middle cooling vent won't shut off completely and blows at my wife when she drives, she was so frustrated I got a piece laminated plastic and velcro strips to hold it in place over the vent.\n",
      "We wish the dual sunroof was an option instead of having to purchase the most expensive model.\n",
      "Also, heads up display has become one of our favorite features (both for safety and convenience) in our GMC Acadia and we wish Infiniti offered it.\n",
      "Captain chairs in the center row would be a nice option, but not critical since you can slide a seat forward with a car seat in it.\n",
      "The radio controls are too low in way of cups & require you to look down.\n",
      "The controls are also too easily changed on steering wheel & other control buttons for other car functions have to be pressed hard & directly.\n",
      "Jul 8, 2016We purchased the poly-steel coating, but already the edges of two doors are chipped & the roof was scratched by some flying road hazard.\n",
      "Maybe door guards would help the door chipping problem, since the coating isn't meant to help prevent these kind of \"injuries.\"\n",
      "I did not realize that this wouldn't allow Bluetooth streaming of music.\n",
      "The only way to play music through my iPhone is when hardwired through the USB port.\n",
      "Despite the fact that I plug the phone in, the car controls work very seldom to control the music.\n",
      "This is particularly apparent when driving on rural hilly roads without any street lights.\n",
      "On the MDX my radio information was visible there... volume, song playing from Ipod, etc.\n",
      "Otherwise I love the comfort, performance, and appearance of my QX60.\n",
      "It has a nice ride, is comfortable, and a pleasure to drive.\n",
      "The Bluetooth connection to iPhone for music doesn't always work.\n",
      "In addition, the seats in the second row don't extend all of the way to the door - there is a lot of wasted space between the seat and door that would be helpful to have for car seats!\n",
      "Would love to be able to fit three car seats across the second row!\n",
      "Safety features are very good as is front-seat comfort.\n",
      "The third-row seat is much too cramped for an adult but does add additional cargo room which was a part of my buying decision.\n",
      "While the finishes on the QX60 feel somewhat luxurious, the tech packages especially the infotainment system, are very outdated.\n",
      "The head rest on the third row seats are too big makes visibility difficult, it would have been better if it could be push down/pull up like the Pathfinder.\n",
      "I love the interior and the extra features.\n",
      "I'm surprised the at noises (creaking/rattling) from the rear that the dealer has thus far not been able to find and correct.\n",
      "Does not compare in quietness and comfortable driving with our Lexus LS (but, then again, it is an SUV, not a luxury sedan).\n",
      "Well appointed vehicle, roomy and quiet except for engine sound when accelerating.\n",
      "Back window small and vehicle has significant blind spots.\n",
      "I wish the headlights could be HID, like other manufactures are offering for such expensive vehicle.\n",
      "The only I don't really like is the backup camera, the image quality is blurry, almost impossible to see anything.\n",
      "For the price of the vehicle, wish some things were more quality like the camera system, being able to purchase 20\" tires at time of purchase instead of spending 6900 more for the option.\n",
      "The only issues I have with the vehicle is the rattle from the back seat cup holders and the inability to customize the home screen at startup.\n",
      "Good handling, comfortable interior.\n",
      "Some bit of road noise still from tires.\n",
      "But overall comfortable nice ride with all the upgrades.\n",
      "Feels like a luxury ride.\n",
      "Also the sunroof wind guard broke just after a month of use, I expect better re ability from a brand new car.\n",
      "Needs automatic closing doors.\n",
      "Aug 5, 2016One option that I would have chosen, or I didn't see it listed, would have been automatic door closure like my Lexus LS460 had.\n",
      "Love the seat heater and cooling.\n",
      "I would have liked for rear backup sensors to be included in this base model!\n",
      "It freezes, resets and reboots regularly and is a hazard to safe driving.\n",
      "The only interior change I would have liked as an option is a wood steering wheel available on the larger SUV.\n",
      "Also the tires on the car seem to be cheap.\n",
      "Navigation screen difficult to see in bright light or when wearing sunglasses.\n",
      "Very reliable and gas efficient.\n",
      "Comfortable seating.\n",
      "Why are their pull handles on every door except the driver side?\n",
      "Rides quiet, smooth, and comfortable.\n",
      "Seats seven and good room for all.\n",
      "Implement an electronic emergency brake/parking brake system.\n",
      "Would have liked to have cooled seats.\n",
      "The interior, ride, and style of the vehicle are exceptional, but the luxuries are WAY behind the curve and should be in the $40K range, not $80K.\n",
      "The heated seats controls are impossible to read, unless you are stopped and look in-line with them, perfectly perpendicular.\n",
      "AND worse than all, it will only read certain files, so the higher quality .Wav files will NOT Play.\n",
      "Wait, a vehicle with an MSRP of $82K and I can't play a CD-quality file, Nor an iTunes file...\n",
      "It must be a medium quality MP3???\n",
      "The Blind spot indicators are near the line of site but, unlike competitors, not in the line of site, causing me to have to look for them and not simply see them embedded in the mirror.\n",
      "Hollow sounding doors make this vehicle seem so cheap.\n",
      "Overall, I've been satisfied, but the QX 80 delivers on the big features, comfort and drive, but falls short in most other categories.\n",
      "The vehicle is sharp looking, Handles well, is powerful and safe.\n",
      "Its safety features are top of the line.\n",
      "Its tech and display are dated, there is no texting capability, the headphones are poor quality compared to the overall audio.\n",
      "Kids have a hard time with the seat belts.\n",
      "I like the real plug option for phone charging.\n",
      "Oct 22, 2016Overall the vehicle is great, but gas efficiency, lack of HD radio, and current app technology is ridiculous at the price point.\n",
      "I actually assumed the vehicle had these features because all other luxury vehicles do, and was very disappointed to find it did not.\n",
      "A/C controls, seat comfort, soft leather, safety features all great.\n",
      "Really good smart and clear backup, side, and front cameras.\n",
      "Only negatives are small interior door handles, sound system not as strong or clear as Toyota Sequoia, steering not as tight as expected, highway gas mileage less than expected.\n",
      "There is an issue with a shrill sound in the brakes that I would really like to get fixed.\n",
      "I hate that shrill sound when I brake.\n",
      "First, when I engage the brakes, there a shrill sound that happens most often than not.\n",
      "The sound is annoying and I am disappointed if this is a normal feature.\n",
      "Regarding the interior door handles, they are angled so that it is very hard to grab to close.\n",
      "When traveling with a full middle row, the middle seat doesn't have access to any cupholders because they are part of the middle seat.\n",
      "I'm not sure if it's the angle of the windshield and it's more prone to absorbing the rocks or if it's just my driving!!!\n",
      "Rear entertainment system should have Blu-ray player.\n",
      "In-dash screen and rear ent.\n",
      "Cup holders in doors are a complete fail.\n",
      "When door shuts, drink splashes everywhere.\n",
      "Area under arm rest between seats could be deeper or have it lift like the qx60.\n",
      "Would be nice for phone to charge while car is off.\n",
      "Cup holders on the back of the center console so second row and front could use them.\n",
      "At this price point, there should be dual exhausts and multiple options for adjustable headrests as they are not very comfortable and cannot be adjusted.\n",
      "A power sunroof shade is also desirable.\n",
      "Feb 22, 2016Would like to see better designed adjustable headrests for front passengers.\n",
      "Also a power sunshade on sunroof would be nice on vehicle at this price point.\n",
      "It would also be better if the third-row seats went completely flat in the cargo area.\n",
      "Oct 9, 2016I wish that the rear cargo area went totally FLAT and had an additional 6 inches in width and 18 inches in length.\n",
      "Avoid camera system if driving in areas with snowÃ¢ÂÂsensors get covered and alarm.\n",
      "Think this is the best value for its class and size in luxury suv.\n",
      "My two largest complaints are lack of total miles a full tank of gas can go even on highway and navigation and panel interface.\n",
      "It is a luxurious ride with the ability to tow a medium sized trailer.\n",
      "The rear seats are as comfortable as the front seats so it is an excellent vehicle for the family on long road trips.\n",
      "The buttons for garage door opening should have been designed on the bottom of the mirror.\n",
      "When you push the buttons, the mirror will move slightly down and have to be adjusted.\n",
      "The technical package, quality of the drive, and comfort of the vehicle are superior to anything we've driven.\n",
      "Start offering more colors in the more expensive brands along with more interior color options.\n",
      "I wish the third row seat folded flat.\n",
      "Aug 8, 2016Love it overall, would like to see third row cargo area fold flat like in the Toyota Sequoia.\n",
      "I hate that the wheat color seats get stained from jeans and is so difficult to remove, wish I had gotten darker seats.\n",
      "Need to integrate Waze Navigation through Android, Include cordless charging, Offer different tint levels,\n",
      "The ride is quiet, smooth, and the vehicle has a ton of power.\n",
      "I constantly lose memory settings.\n",
      "Put USB charging ports in the back seats.\n",
      "Camera clarity needs improvement.\n",
      "Driver's side and trunk keyless entry really need to be standard with this level of product or at least offered as a reasonably priced option to the Premium model.\n",
      "I would trade the retractable side mirrors for the keyless entry feature.\n",
      "The radio/speakers could be improved, as the sound quality is below average, particularly for a luxury car.\n",
      "I prefer the radio dial be shown where the gauges are located in the center dash, but then you sacrifice vehicle dataÃ¢ÂÂI would like to at least see how many miles until I am out of fuel in the dashboard without having all of the other vehicle data.\n",
      "The current problem (which is taking two weeks to get into the dealer to fix) is that the backup camera does not appear to be centered properly, and I am taking to the dealer next week.\n",
      "The axle hump greatly reduces the functionality of the back seat and a center third passenger.\n",
      "Also, the fuel mileage on the highway should be a lot better, although I would trade that for a larger gas tank and the ability to drive 350 miles on a single tank of gas (now I am lucky to get 285 miles in mixed driving).\n",
      "The sunroof button also does not retract the roof or screen (or close it) without holding down the button the entire time, which seems odd and a little arcane in this day and age.\n",
      "The sideview mirrors should have an integrated blind spot mirror built into them, as there is a slight blind spot on each side of the car that this would greatly alleviate.\n",
      "Also, the armrest in the backseat should have cup holders built into them, as the lower door panel location does not work for young children, particularly those in car seats.\n",
      "I don't like the orientation of the window controls on the driver side as it appears the lock/mirror controls should be switched and the windows down on the armrest.\n",
      "Not having a light on the sun visor mirror seems like a glaring omission, even if you just put an LED light up there that runs on a watch battery, it would be fine.\n",
      "The heated seats get really hot and there does not seem like much difference between the three levels.\n",
      "The best part of the car is that it drives impeccably and is a ton of fun to drive and the exterior and interior styling looks great too.\n",
      "Having the ability to automatically connect to more than one phone (different driver with their phone).\n",
      "Make sure the quality is there and the issues with technology is minimal.\n",
      "The vehicle when stopped completely, and the brake is pressed down on, should automatically hold the vehicle in the stopped position until the gas is pressed.\n",
      "Exterior mini lights should be added on each of the four door handles and rear like the BMW SUVs have.\n",
      "Back seat cupholders need to be added (the door cupholders are ineffective).\n",
      "Standard with the backup camera should be alerts (standard backup camera will not make any noises if you approach or hit an object).\n",
      "Slow reactions to user input, music from USB skips frequently, Navi doesn't clear once car has reached a destination and will continue to guide to the same destination as you leave to go home, AM/FM radio sometimes is \"unavailable,\" etc.\n",
      "The door panels rattle when bassy music is played, grade of leather(heated/AC) seats seem low and the seat contour expects my shoulders to be five inches lower so does not fit my tall back.\n",
      "Jaguar should provide similar trim, better/higher quality trim level, electronic and convenience items usually found in similar and lower-level prestige vehicles, such as: heated seats, seatbelt height adjustment, lights on driver and passenger sun visors, a CD player, luxury floor mats, less use of plastic or better use of material where there is too much plastic, leather seats, little to no interior storage space for the driver, someplace to put the key-fob to name a few.\n",
      "This is a very well made  reliable and sophisticated vehicle that offer excellent performance and is truly fun to drive.\n",
      "Jan 21, 2018Need to improve the media, navigation and smartphone interface for functionality, ease of use and reliability.\n",
      "Use a bit more high quality materials in the interior for a car of this class and focus on sound dampening in doors to avoid vibration from the superior Meridian sound system.\n",
      "CONTINENTAL EXTREMECONTACT DWS 06 is by far a better tire since we never drive on a perfect road.\n",
      "The contact screen should return to navigation display automatically.\n",

      "Or if I'm not using a specific feature, send me messages to inform me and perhaps include videos on how & when to use.\n",
      "Wished I would have purchased the backup camera (should be standard) and memory seats.\n",
      "Front seat module had to be replaced when the car was less than three weeks oldÃ¢ÂÂwas not reimbursed for 700 miles nor hotel room when having to drive to the dealership twice to diagnose and then replace the seat module.\n",
      "My only complaint with the car is the hardness of drivers seat bolsterÃ¢ÂÂgetting in and out of the car has caused left upper leg problemsÃ¢ÂÂvery irritating when you are getting in and out of the car multiple times a day.\n",
      "For the future, can the design team please evaluate making the Auto-Start-Stop an optional feature, such as Cruise Control?\n",
      "b)  Regarding In-Control Touch Pro (ICTP),  occasionally the Sirius XM radio cuts out (no music), and the backup camera does not work.\n",
      "Please no run-flat tires, and keep the steering feel & feedback excellent.\n",
      "Make sure you keep the manual transmissions (and PLEASE make them available across the range, including in AWD sports sedans and sports cars), DO NOT go to Run-Flat Tires (they are the reason I abandoned BMW), and don't forget that there are still those of us out there who love to drive and are passionate about cars.\n",
      "No voice activation on navigation system, while less expensive models do.\n",
      "To change the temperature or radio volume you must hit the control one time for each change instead of pressing and holding to achieve your desired level.\n",
      "No hook to hold up the cover while accessing the spare tire compartment.\n",
      "On a recent trip I learned that my heated windshield might interfere with my EZ Pass transponder.\n",
      "However, once a turned the engine off and restarted the car - the windows worked again.\n",
      "I was also surprised to learn that there are no cupholders in the second row seats - this may be because I bought the base model.\n",
      "One option I wish came standard on the F-Pace is that the keyless entry included the ability to unlock and lock vehicle which door handle sensor.\n",
      "Beautiful, powerful, elegant, smooth, and fun to drive.\n",
      "Jaguar could significantly increase my satisfaction in owning, driving, and riding in this vehicle through:\r\n",

      "Passenger side rear view mirror turns down during reverse, which is excellent, BUT it does not always return to its default position after shifting from reverse.\n",
      "Off to a shaky start, our F-Pace was in the shop for nearly a month while new as they tried to fix a backup camera problem.\n",
      "While there, they tinted the front windows and damaged several interior pieces that needed to be replaced.\n",
      "Also had issues with a door not unlocking, stranding the front passenger in the car, had to open from the outside.\n",

      "In a vehicle that is already expensive and premium, where you put up the money also for the top of the line audio, this is a HUGE oversight.\n",
      "Just FIX THE DOOR RATTLE!\n",
      "Also, the adaptive cruise/lane assist could use a bit of work...\n",
      "Improve idling, interior noise at high speeds, make the suspension less stiff, avoid including accessories that require a lot of effort from the customer to install, do not include frills (Jaguar number plate frame, for example)\n",

      "2.the touch screen on the navigation is almost unusable when the vehicle is moving, and a bit old fashioned.\n",
      "A little (very little) problem - driver cargo size - no much room for small things - like a keys, phone(s), wallet, candies, change, etc :) \r\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "And second little problem - I have a diesel and have trouble time to fuel it.\n",

      "The window controls being higher than the armrest is an awful, uncomfortable location and is awful!\n",
      "While I love driving the car, I feel that when it came to having a vanity mirror light that should have been included in the purchase price.\n",
      "I could have bought a Chevy for half the price and there would be a light.\n",
      "The interior circulation should not need to have the button pressed each time you enter the vehicle.\n",

      "I love the vehicle in handling and appearance but have had a variety of electronic issues and a creaking noise from the steering column.\n",
      "Don't at all like the start and stop economy setting, it should be off unless you want the engine to save gas.\n",

      "There appears to be ample space for a fold-down compartment next to the Emergency buttons on the ceiling next to the three interior light buttons.\n",
      "Also, there should have been a compartment in between the seats of the coupe instead of the pocket on top.\n",
      "This means that whenever you come to a complete stop, the engine stops until you take your foot off the brake.\n",
      "The same thing for the tuned exhaust sound.\n",
      "Then there are these neon yellow and white airbag warning stickers that are on the visors.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But having the Jaguar for such a short period and having all these issues makes me very nervous  for the future.\n",
      "Secondly this car should have wifi connectivity which is almost inexcusable in this price range in 2016 and adaptive cruise control.\n",
      "Performed very well as daily driver in winter with Blizzak snow tires and ice/snow mode engaged.\n",
      "I chose it because it was a newer brand/model with more powerful engine and similar AWD to Audi RS5 also more exotic less typical/everyday looking than Audi.\n",
      "It is high performance, sporty and makes a great comfortable daily driver that is completely impractical and of uncertain reliability but exceedingly stylish.\n",

      "Dec 1, 2016I love my new car but it unfortunately has supported the clichs about British car building reliability.\n",
      "There are things I would change about the interior, like a pass-through to the trunk between the seats for easy storage and better (more modern) gauges on the dash.\n",
      "I love the quality, style, handling and excitement of my FType.\n",
      "I love....the audio system especially with the top down on the interstate and competitive vehicles I drove were inferior to Jaguar...major reason besides the overall styling and performance.\n",

      "Excellent styling, power, and handling.\n",
      "Apr 7, 2016One concern I have is that whatever material is used for the brake pads  produces an excessive amount of black dust or material that collects on my wheels and along the side of the car, and I have to constantly be cleaning the vehicle to remove it.\n",
      "With a brand like Jaguar, it should NOT come with a low-quality sound system.\n",
      "Aug 5, 2016Needs a garage door opener.\n",

      "The worst surprise in the trunk space, which is not that small, if you are hauling Ping-Pong balls, but not a useful shape for hard luggage and groceries or cases of wine, etc.\n",
      "Given the poor rear visibility, the lack of a rearview camera on a $68K automobile is unforgivable.\n",
      "Door handles look cheap.\n",
      "On a $68K car, I should have backup camera and proximity warning.\n",

      "It would be better to drive as much of the interface as possible via the phone.\n",
      "For example, my vehicle can sense a vehicle in the adjoining lane, but nothing more (lane shift warning, automatic stop, etc).\n",
      "(3) The sensor systems are way too slow.\n",
      "The parking sensor, adjoining vehicle, and rear approaching are late enough as to not be effective except at exceedingly slow speed.\n",

      "While the backup camera is quite good, it will frequently not come on when reverse is selected.\n",
      "The compressor then will quickly turn on again thus reducing the humidity, I assume this is done to improve fuel economy, but it is very annoying in the Florida climate.\n",
      "I still haven't gotten around to working out the voice commands, which I want to do, as tapping in information on the navigation or phone is difficult and dangerous while driving (I know there's a warning to not do this, but sometimes it's unavoidable).\n",
      "I hate that the tires and clearance are so low that even the slightest bump or hole in the road gives an uncomfortable jolt.\n",
      "The navigation is still not totally reliable.\n",
      "The back seat is just too small.\n",
      "There is not enough room for feet to be comfortable, and one has to angle one's feet to be able to set them down to exit the car.\n",
      "The high ledge makes this even more difficult, as one has to climb up out of the back seat.\n",
      "Also, the sides of the car are high, which looks pretty, but makes it very hard to see where the passenger front wheels are when parallel parking, and also difficult to see over the hood to see where the front of the car ends.\n",
      "I'm not a tall person and can't get high enough in the driver's seat to look over the hood.\n",
      "Confusing door controls (two-level, non-logical arrangement).\n",

      "Vehicles such as jaguar should come with safety features standard.\n",
      "Sep 25, 2016I loved my car, but as expressed earlier in this survey, I believe that the security features such as \"blind spot\" monitoring and brake assist should be standard in all cars.\n",
      "This should not be considered luxury item but safety items.\n",
      "With this said, I love my car and somewhat regret not to have paid the extra money to get these features in my car...\n",

      "I would much prefer to have a considerably higher priced vehicle with all the features.\n",
      "Also, the interior of the Prestige is nice, and the ambient lighting wonderful, but it still is not quite the full Jaguar style.\n",
      "As to the paint, at first I did not like it because in the light it looked like too much glitter (racing green), but when the sun goes down it is outstanding.\n",
      "When accelerating, then engine sometimes sounds like it struggles.\n",
      "Please make all safety features available (at least as optional) on all trim levels.\n",
      "Consumer Reports complains when safety features aren't standard.\n",
      "I would be satisfied if safety features were available (as options, at least) on all trim levels, rather than just on the higher levels.\n",
      "I would very much like to see Jaguar support flash performance upgrades to the ECU of their engine...now there is a 380 HP XE-S that who's engine map can easily be replicated in the 340HP 2017 XE-S,  and at this time performance oriented customers are driven to aftermarket solutions by Jaguar Corporate.\n",
      "There are several tunes available that will safely boost the performance of this engine safely to over 415HP,  for only $1000.00 or less!\n",
      "I'm disappointed that the fuel door has no inside security latch, and/or that a locking fuel cap isn't available as a dealer/owner installed option from the parts department.\n",
      "You have to use the folding \"Swiss Army Key\" that is tucked away in the keyless entry fob to lock and unlock it.\n",
      "The car has one inherent serious problem: the front and rear tires are different sizes, thus making it impossible to carry a real spare tire (even if there were room in the trunk, which there isn't).\n",
      "Love everything about  with the exception of the park assist and rear sun screen does not automatically go down when car is put in reverse.\n",
      "Aug 17, 2016car shots off when driving, working with dealer to fix, why does front parking assist turn off??\n",
      "Front camera does not engage unless I stop, put in N, then back to D.  Will have to take to dealer, 150 miles for repair.\n",
      "Software occasionally hangs on startup screen upon starting car, or hangs on camera screen after backing out of driveway.\n",
      "Needs more space in the rear.\n",
      "The wheel design needs to be better for the base models and all jags need to have the jaguar signature LED lights.\n",
      "Sep 27, 2016I have not once regretted my purchase, however the two (2) issues I have mentioned in this survey regard: 1) the navigation system that has given incorrect directions on a few occasions and; (2) there is loud noise coming from the back end of the car when I'm driving with the windows down at @40-45 mph.\n",
      "Having to use the key fob without keyless entry is rather annoying.\n",
      "The interior dash seems very minimalistic, could use some \"wow\" factors.\n",
      "The entry and exit from the car for me, an old gent, is a bit difficult since the doors don't seem to remain open and the leather seats are difficult to remove oneself.\n",
      "The handbook is not very clear on many of the options available in the navigation screens - for example,\r\n",
      "how to turn on vocal speed warnings, how to clear mpg for a trip, etc.\n",
      "I cannot believe how Jaguar was able to put so much style, performance, and economy into the XE.\n",
      "I have to lay the back seats down and put the cooler on the seats because it will not clear the height of the trunk.\n",
      "I feel that there are some semi blind spot and am trying to get used to the visuals.\n",
      "There should be some sort of mechanism in conjunction to the camera to let me know how close I am to something in the rear.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016Jaguar has changed the game and I am so blessed to have a rebowned luxury car that in my eyes is better than German engineering.\n",
      "3 big complaints I have 1) sound system is atrociously poor quality.\n",

      "Aug 5, 2016Our Jaguar XJL was a little too big, when the XE came out, we test drove it and it was a perfect mix of size, performance, and luxury!\n",
      "Because of my height 6'2\", getting in and out of the driver seat is a little difficult.\n",
      "I wish there were more driver seat settings so that the seat comes up a little higher.\n",

      "I could use a little higher trunk.\n",
      "Would like for the seat to go higher.\n",
      "Up until that point I had never owned a car that was so thoroughly reliable, stylish and fun to drive.\n",

      "The price of the vehicle provides a younger buyer with minimal features.\n",
      "It would be nice to have blind spot and keyless entry.\n",
      "I love that the rear camera is available at the push of a button and automatically upon reversing.\n",
      "The seats are very comfortable for road trips.\n",
      "Here I refer to the fact that leather seats are now an option and that even Prestige models come with minimal or in my case no real wood trim at all!\n",
      "It is certainly nice to be driving an authentically different luxury automobile when viewed from the outside but it is more important to keep the interior equally luxurious because that is what the owner/driver really sees and lives in.\n",
      "However, the little rattles and squeaks from the dash are annoying for such an expensive car.\n",
      "My ONLY issue with the car is the little rattles and squeaks in the interior.\n",
      "Its important to me to have a car that others will view as top quality, sporty, stylish, not the same old car everyone else has, etc.\n",
      "I want a car that doesn't rattle, looks sharp this year and five years from now, maintains value and is durable.\n",
      "Jaguar has made large investments in styling and long term reliability and that is what drew me to the XF.\n",
      "During phone calls and/or while attempting to listen to music.\n",
      "Price and options/packages are better than BMW 535 and 435, although I like the styling of the 435.\n",
      "Jaguar drove better than the others IMO and the seats felt perfect from the moment I got in.\n",
      "Friends and family say the backseat is extremely comfortable.\n",
      "Wish I had gone for the upgraded stereo as I miss the music HDD (not available in base radio) but I don't need the upgraded speakers, etc, so I didn't realize SD or HDD wasn't on the base radio.\n",

      "Apr 1, 2016I don't care for the headrest on the seats.\n",
      "The 1.6 liter turbo Forte5 door is a very good looking car.\n",
      "The only problem that I have with the 2016 Kia Forte interior is that you can't adjust the headrest on the chairs.\n",
      "It's great on gas mileage and is a comfortable ride.\n",
      "Sometimes it just sounds like windows are open.\n",
      "My main issue is the wind noise coming from the door & window seals.\n",
      "It drives great, ride great.\n",
      "It handles well, the gas mileage is phenomenal, the sound system is very good.\n",
      "A pleasure to drive, I feel safe and confident.\n",
      "Lots of power for such a small engine!\n",

      "I learned about the reuse of used batteries (great potential).\n",
      "And just improve the base sound system a bit as the only means to upgrade was to spend a lot more money on a higher-end model.\n",
      "good and bad points give some way to choose to have the engine engage the wheels when starting in a hurry without the delay that is present now.\n",
      "Apr 9, 2018Make list of features that shown on dealers web sites the same as the window sticker and do not include things that are expected such as AC, RADIO ETC.\n",

      "The functionality of applications (navigation, satellite radio, podcasts, music) useable through CarPlay is so far, far superior to those apps installed in the car that I wish the car's whole system could be bypassed or eliminated.\n",
      "Basically, we just want to drive our phone.\n",
      "The only things that could be made better on this vehicle is to make the center console extend further forward, install a 360 degree camera.\n",
      "The only thing that I would warn you about would be the standard seats, which still have a standard bar to make the seat go forward and backward; for a disabled person, this makes adjusting the seat virtually impossible.\n",
      "Aug 16, 2016I wished the options for power seat would have been included in the basic package (as it is in most cars today) instead of having to forego it without buying the EX package.\n",
      "Being a paraplegic driver who has to load and unload a chair, it would go a long way to adjusting the seat out of the way when bringing the chair inside the car.\n",
      "The interior is quite roomy, even with the front seat fully back, there is plenty of room even for our long-legged friends.\n",
      "The amount of road noise transmitting to the interior seems inconsistent with the overall quality of the vehicleÃ¢ÂÂperhaps the next year model will correct this anomaly.\n",
      "I love the Optima and am pleased with the new rear side windows to help eliminate blind spots.\n",
      "I have been pleasantly surprised by the ride and handling of the car.\n",
      "You will not find a better buy that has practical features and a few extras like push button start, touchless trunk entry, satellite radio, and folding mirrors.\n",

      "The only problem mentioned is that my smart trunk feature does not seem to work and apparently was not demonstrated by my sales professionals.\n",
      "In the future I want all the bells and whistles, such as auto start, wireless phone charging, smart truck etc.\n",
      "I wish I had been asked about the remote control option for the garage door opener.\n",
      "Apr 14, 2016Vehicle is great but I was disappointed to realize the garage door opener option was not standard.\n",

      "Move heated seat button to the dash board.\n",
      "Great overall value and performance.\n",
      "I really appreciate Android Auto.\n",
      "The Optima SXL is a technologically sophisticated vehicle for the money, but Kia needs to keep on top of it.\n",
      "I love the seat comfort in all 3 rows of seats, the steering wheel that is also adjustable in distance from the driver, the memory feature for seat adjustments, safety features, the fuel economy, the outside rearview mirrors that automatically fold when the car is locked, the ability to electronically fold those mirrors and keep them folded when parking in the garage, the automatic headlights (our Honda Odyssey that we previously owned did not have headlights that automatically came on when needed and we occasionally forgot to turn them on since the dashboard lights were always on), the sound system and electronic controls, the ease of getting into the 3rd row seat and the power of the engine.\n",
      "Features that I liked better on the 2005 Honda Odyssey that I previously owned were the underfloor storage compartment (apparently missing in the Kia since 4-wheel drive is available, but Kia ought to be able to find another location for such a compartment), the middle row seats that can be folded and moved (or removed) to make more storage space in the back than the Sedona has, the flat and even floor in the storage area, somewhat better handling on the highway and a more comfortable ride (the Kia has a very firm ride).\n",
      "Additionally, Kia should provide a larger screen for the back-up camera and automatic stopping when there is a hazard ahead on all models of the Sedona.\n",
      "I wish all the seats folded down like they do in the Pacifica.\n",
      "I also wish it had heated mirrors so in the winter the side mirrors would clear up.\n",
      "On the steering wheel, it would be nice instead of having the little knobs that turn to reset and change the volume if they were buttons instead of dials that you turn.\n",
      "Quite frequently when you are turning the steering wheel your hands very easily hit those knobs and change the volume of the radio, that can be very annoying.\n",
      "Also it would be nice if this van had heated mirrors so in the winter or rainy weather they would clear up so you could see.\n",
      "I am seriously thinking of getting a different brand of minivan, so I can get a minivan where all of the seats fold down for more cargo space.\n",
      "Some issues:\r\n",
      "- Climate control for the back is only on one side\r\n",
      "- Front and back cupholders are not in the best locations\r\n",
      "- No standard plug/outlet for power\r\n",
      "- No option to leave power outlet on\r\n",
      "- No armrests\r\n",
      "- Clock is in a bad location on the dash\r\n",
      "- Dash screen is too small and has limited functionality (mostly radio)\r\n",
      "- Dash screen is too far to reach\r\n",
      "- Rear window is small\r\n",
      "- Seat warmers are turned off (does not come on when using remote starter)\r\n",
      "- Controls on steering wheel are difficult to learn (too many possibilities - not labeled clearly).\n",
      "Our KIA Sedona is a very nice, comfortable vehicle with a lot of power when needed.\n",
      "The power side doors and lift-gate are awesome and so convenient, as is the smart key.\n",
      "My sons love the reclining back seats, but I do find them difficult to move around.\n",
      "The light from the panoramic sunroof is nice, but you cannot drive very fast with it open, although the front one is fine to use wide-open on the highway -- thanks to the deflector I had the dealership add for me.\n",
      "We got an excellent quality vehicle at a fair price and plan on keeping it for a while.\n",
      "One, the displays for the air conditioning are difficult to read on bright sunny days.\n",
      "The red LED displays are very difficult to read with sunglasses on during bright days (ever without sunglasses they re hard to read.)\n",
      "I would highly recommend daytime running lights I think should be mandatory LED style \r\n",
      "I think that blind spot side mirrors should be mandatory \r\n",
      "I think that rear turn signals should be yellow to attract attention better \r\n",
      "I also think there should be like a safety device with the push button starting that deactivates or something when you shut it off or if you some how to forget to turn it off and walk away in a garage so it doesn't stay running and kill you.\n",
      "I Love not needing to remove any seats in order to use my Sedona to haul large amounts of stuff.\n",
      "I like having 8 seats when I need them.\n",
      "I like being able to have a center isle between the middle row of seats if I want it.\n",
      "The 19inch wheels make for an excellent ride.\n",
      "the seats are very comfortable with A/C and Heating .\n",
      "Many luxury features make it a pleasure to own and drive.\n",
      "But I watch 6 grandchildren for my own children and this vehicle holds all their car seats.\n",
      "It is comfortable and functional and I love that I still have cargo room even with 5 carseats installed.\n",
      "I love the DVD player and the bluetooth connectivity.\n",
      "Mar 22, 2016The 2016 Kia Sedona LX is a great vehicle.It's almost a sporty look.We often get complimented on its appearance.It runs smooth and has a good adjustment on speeding up.A real smooth transition when speeding up.The look whether its outside or inside is very beautiful.So much room and comfortness.This for my family and I is truly a Family Van yet with the look and drive of an SUV.Great work to all involved.Thank You for the safety features.\n",
      "Jan 27, 2016My new 2016 Kia Sedona is such a beautiful vehicle it truly turns heads.The color is Titanium Bronze and is not found much.Great color that makes the Sedona stand out.The exterior is supreme compared to all minivans and the interior is beautiful as well.\n",

      "Nov 8, 2016I would like to have had the side door open/close access on driver side door.\n",
      "also wish electronic trunk hatch was available on lx model.\n",
      "It seems as through it is not getting enough gas to take off and go, thus making the gas being used even faster.\n",

      "Other people who never liked Kia have been amazed at how much they like the new style and the comfort.\n",

      "poor steering, can't see instruments, worst owners manual ever, tiny screen for backup camera.\n",
      "The only drawback is ease of loading and stowage when the seats are disabled.\n",
      "In this 21st century, it may be time to move forward in terms of engine technology.\n",
      "I hate all the squeaks and rattles; I also do not like the 2nd row seats and tracks in the floor.\n",
      "All tailgates should have ease of open and close, such as a button to push instead of pulling it open and close.\n",
      "I wish for indivual heating and air conditioning controls for front seat passengers.\n",
      "Could use auto braking and stow and go to make it perfect.\n",
      "The back seat need to be stow away to make it perfect.\n",

      "Great buy, luxury at a affordable price!\n",
      "It's roomy, comfortable, stylish and we love it.\n",
      "Mainly about the safety features and ample space.\n",
      "The safety features like lane assist and the warning if a vehicle stops suddenly in front of me, and having several cameras for parking, make driving so much easier and make me feel more confident driving with my family.\n",
      "I love having the ability to use a third row of seats or have the trunk space to load home improvement materials and the luxury features like heated and cooled seats as well as heated steering wheel make driving so much more comfortable on cold or hot days.\n",
      "The only things I'd change would be bigger brakes and dual symmetrical exhaust.\n",
      "The front driver's seat is not comfortable, this is the worst seat I've ever had to deal with.\n",
      "My knee is pressed up against the area under the steering dashboard, which concerns me if I was in an accident.\n",
      "The pedals are too far forward, but the steering wheel does not extend/telescope back out far enough to compensate.\n",
      "The driver's side mirror creates a blind spot: when cars ahead of me are indicating to change into my lane, it blocks viewing the flashing indicating light of the forward car.\n",
      "The steering wheel needs to be able to telescope out more because the floor pedals are placed too far forward.\n",
      "The drivers seat is too hard, not comfortable, I am always trying to adjust the seat to get settled every time I drive.\n",
      "The headrest doesn't go high enough and is constantly rubbing my back (I'm 6'1\").\n",

      "If my phone is plugged in, I can't use the car's voice control (I'm forced to use Siri).\n",

      "Please add LATCH and a tether bar to the third-row seats.\n",
      "The interactive digital controls display drives me crazy sometimes with its complexity.\n",
      "But, I do really appreciate things like keyless entry, blind spot detection, quality of sound, the smooth and quiet ride, clear controls, and interior design.\n",
      "Rated high in both safety and reliability.\n",
      "One, it really needs to have a telescopic steering wheel for those of us who prefer to sit a little further back so our legs are extended while driving.\n",
      "Second, the Sorento could really use another gear in the transmission.\n",
      "Lastly, the sound deadening needs to be improved; too much road noise.\n",
      "The Sorrento meets my need with safety, power/acceleration, and reasonable comfort.\n",
      "Jul 23, 2016I don't like having so many features as standard, and for which I have no use for.\n",

      "Needs daytime driving lights.\n",
      "When the back seat is in the down position and the front drivers seat is automatically moved back for exiting, it is difficult to pull up the back seat behind the driver because the head restraint is pressed against the back of the drivers seat.\n",

      "Wish the Sorento vehicle I purchased had the dual drivers seat memory...the Optima has it, but our Sorento does not, and it is a great feature that I miss.\n",
      "I recommend a cover / shield for the backup camera, as it isn't usable in rainy condition s. Everyone seems to have a Kia in my county, so not a distinctive vehicle to own, but pleasurable to drive.\n",
      "Oct 26, 2016Love the versatility, comfort and power of my SUV.\n",
      "I would make two adjustment to the vehicle: 1) driver armrest designed higher\r\n",

      "It took several trips before the rear backup camera and hatch lock worked properly causing me to take time away from work on several different days.\n",

      "Aug 19, 2016I can't say enough about this new Kia Sportage: quiet cabin, smoooooooth ride, quiet engine, comfortable seats, wonderful sunroof, ease of controls, and most of all now is the gas mileage, which is wonderful more than the MPG rating.\n",

      "It has 4 doors that make it easy to use a car seat for the grand child.\n",
      "It has a hatch and fold down rear seat to carry large items, such as a bicycle.\n",

      "#1 Interior plastic looks and feels way too cheap for this brand.\n",
      "#4 The HVAC panel, I guess this goes hand in hand with the cheap plastic look, again has a very cheap look to it and looks as if there is an inoperative display about the controls but it nothing but a glossy black piece of plastic plating.\n",
      "#6 DVD headrest entertainment system would be great.\n",
      "#7 Given the poor rear windscreen visibility, blind spot monitoring should be \"standard\" equipment!\n",
      "Feb 2, 2016Only have a few complaints, as we love the vehicle for its safety, off road abilities, and exterior design.\n",
      "One BIG problem is the engine choice, the acceleration from a stop is almost a safety issue!\n",
      "That should be addressed quickly (next model update) and also the cheap plastics really hurt the well designed interior, it's very noticeable at first glance and also feels super cheap!\n",
      "Why can't you change your radio presets from the wheel rather than having to reach over, and why when on satellite radio does it not display artist/song title and when getting top of the line vehicle why charge extra for satellite?\n",
      "Since I purchased an HSE lux I just assumed it would be equipped with this important safety feature.\n",
      "I was also surprised with the sophisticated infotainment system that it doesn't display artist and song as well as satellite station on main screen and when surfing the dial it doesn't surf presets.\n",

      "If you drive slowly with the windows rolled down and radio off, you will hear it rattle.\n",
      "The interior leather seats and steering wheel are extremely well made, but the dash and door finishes could use some refinement (pizzazz!).\n",
      "I feel safe and comfortable, but do get some rattling in my doors, which drives me absolutely crazy.\n",
      "Refine the interior, install a better sound system, and a larger gas tank, and this car would be perfect.\n",
      "The black exterior is the same as the interior...looks dirty.\n",

      "Vehicle is cheaply done in the interior and has annoying bugs with many items such as nobody can describe the automatic collision avoidanceÃ¢ÂÂit's probably non-functioning because when you ask you get different answers.\n",
      "Backup camera has a warning label that does not go away until you finished backing up so its useless.\n",
      "Cheap, incomplete interior.\n",
      "Rides nice, good gas mileage, handles well and has power.\n",

      "The driver's side seat belt does not adjust, which makes it very difficult for someone of my height (5') to use.\n",
      "Also, I really dislike the fact that my car doesn't have a CD player, so the steering wheel controls won't go to the next preset.\n",
      "So the leaning forward to change channels and the non-adjusting seat belt create a very painful scenario where the seat belt nearly decapitates me.\n",

      "Now that I've owned the car for a while, I've found other things that I literally HATE about it.\n",
      "When reverse camera comes up there is a safety warning at the top of the screen.\n",

      "Drive is nice and smooth though and interior is high quality and roomie especially for the exterior footprint of the car.\n",
      "Seats are very important to me, the length of the seat to adjust for support under your legs is important when purchasing.\n",

      "The more ways to adjust your seats the better for individual comfort.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "- Use slightly larger engine, get rid of turbo, performs poorly.\n",
      "It certainly is not worth the money - hate it  A couple months old and trim under drivers door keeps coming unattached.\n",
      "Hate the engine \"shut down\" at lights - even hate the override.\n",
      "Hate the fact that there are no arm rests and dislike the dial for drive - reverse etc.\n",
      "I was greatly disappointed that a car of this caliber came without a standard CD player or Satellite radio.\n",
      "I realize I can use other technology, however, I like to play my CD's and have the satellite radio available.\n",
      "Also, told that the hatch cover behind the rear seat was now an \"option\"....\n",
      "Other \"below par\" observations: (1) the seats become uncomfortable with long use, (2) acceleration from standing still is ragged and somewhat unresponsive, and (3) some of the controls require driver distraction to operate when under way.\n",
      "Wish it had more horsepower, although the turbo charge works great.\n",
      "same as before - higher horsepower, larger fuel tank.\n",
      "Perfect handling and creature comforts.\n",
      "The two problems I have had with my LD discovery 2016 are: (1) The trunk does not always open or close on demand (using the key or button underneath the steering wheel).\n",
      "(2) The rear mirrors do dip down when backing up (an option I have chosen), but they do not always dip back up when back on Drive mode.\n",
      "The steering wheel controls only allow you to seek radio stations instead of switching to your next preset.\n",
      "Having to lean forward to touch the screen to change my preset is dangerous while driving.\n",

      "It also has an attractive interior and good sound system.\n",
      "My wife has shared that the front seats could use a bit more shaping on the front edge; they tend to put her legs \"to sleep\" on long drives.\n",
      "The doors do not provide any additional benefit for storing an extra bottle of water.\n",
      "Also, the right rear tail light seems to have a leak (condensation inside lenses while washing it) which I notified dealership about and they asked me to bring it in to fix.\n",
      "At cruising speeds (engine rpms @1700 or lower) there is a vibration which makes the dashboard etc.\n",
      "Oct 28, 2016Needs a bigger, more powerful engine.\n",
      "There needs to be a cupholder on the dash to the left of the steering wheel.\n",
      "I am very disappointed that there is only one camera to assist with parking.\n",
      "Apr 15, 2016I so wish there was a cupholder to the left of the steering wheel.\n",
      "This vehicle is finished nicely but the engine is not powerful.\n",
      "Also, the back seat is tight for adults and the rear cupholders are an afterthought.\n",
      "Was super disappointed to not be able to use apps and phone in the way I need to.\n",
      "Not including a cargo cover on a HSE model comes across as sneaky and cheap.\n",
      "Small center console, Small seat back pockets.\n",
      "Capable, roomy, looks good, transmission shifts rough, could be more luxurious for the price (to much plastic in interior).\n",
      "The front seats are very uncomfortable even though they were the luxury model.\n",
      "The automatic shutdown of the engine when idle is dangerous and will be very expensive to repair.\n",
      "Smart looking design, great sun roof, comfortable to drive, power with good gas mileage.\n",
      "Enjoy the car, especially with my two-tone (black+red) exterior package, but the interior is a bit on the low-end scale.\n",
      "Transmission is clumsy, one of the right side speakers blew out not too long after purchase.\n",
      "Irregular noise coming from trunk door.\n",
      "For this higher end car even for basic models, I think it should still have satellite radio and garage door opener options.\n",

      "On a positive note (pun intended), the basic sound system is by far the most impressive I have had in any vehicle I own...makes me want to get out there and drive it more!\n",
      "Voice menus need to be improved, connectivity with iPhone needs to be more seamless, takes too long to connect w Bluetooth and is disruptive to phone calls when getting in/out of car, dash should be higher quality leather for a $100k car, wheels/rims should look nicer for $100k car, Sirius XM should include 1 year minimum not 3 months, I was never offered 3rd row and I would've bought it, also it's somewhat difficult to put luggage and a stroller in the back which is surprising based on the size of the back.\n",
      "Incredible fuel economy with the diesel, I'm definitely getting another RR when my lease is over in 19 months.\n",
      "I hope LR makes some\r\n",
      "Improvements to interior and technology before I buy my next one.\n",

      "In LA traffic, my sensors beep all the time.\n",
      "I also have an issue with the rear seat heaters not turning off after the vehicle has been shut down and later turned on again.\n",
      "If there is no longer someone in the rear seat, there is no way of knowing the heaters or coolers are on.\n",
      "The 4 biggest drawbacks are:\r\n",
      "1) The cup holders are not very comfortable to use and most cups or water bottles don't fit properly.\n",
      "2) The navigation is awful, so end up using my smart phone for directions.\n",
      "4) The door storage is very narrow which makes getting things out difficult.\n",
      "Computer screen is slow to load, ready to drive, and still waiting for all to load so I can put seats on AC before driving.\n",
      "Apr 17, 2016Only problems I had were two flat tires, so should not be charged against quality of vehicle, wondering about Continental, but issue may have blown any tire, and RR road service was superior.\n",

      "I moved from a Long Wheel Base Autobiography to the Range Range rover HSE with a full bodypack.\n",

      "I am having new rattle issues most likely coming from the rear seat belt re tractor belt units.\n",
      "It could might as well be something in the rear seat.\n",

      "Also, I noticed an odd noise that appears to be coming from radio when the windshield wipers are turned on.\n",
      "Those reasons for \"lower scores\" re my new NX200t vehicle:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. flat tire non-service in the first weeks (not the fault of the tire but a nail puncture) of ownership; \"cannot fit you in until next week; just change the tire and put the spare on\" from service dept was annoying (we are both seniors) ...'called AAA and guy changed the tire and ordered a new one and left us with the 'donut\" to drive on for the weekend; for a Lexus price, I DO expect a full-size tire--even if it ups the price by fifty bucks; AAA serviceperson came on Monday and replaced the tire.\n",
      "That old interior design was EXCELLENT (but I am very happy that Lexus finally came up with a SUV smaller design than the RX350)\r\n",
      "4. the cooled seats produce a \"whoosh sound\" by the driver's left ear.\n",
      "Also the Navigation took away my fear of \"not being able to meet someone at night\" because using my phone's GPS was sketchy.\n",
      "It is exactly what I wanted: a compact luxury hybrid SUV.\n",
      "There are a couple of features that I wish it had: collision breaking when not engaged with the dynamic cruise control; and, turning the accessories off after the driver door is open (not when the vehicle is turned off).\n",
      "I would like the car radio to stay on until I open the car door, instead of pushing the start button.\n",
      "I would like the blind spot warning to also send an audio alert in addition to the flashing light on the rear view mirror.\n",
      "I would have like the lane departure warning option available on the NX 300h.\n",
      "There is a known issue by Lexus that the rear speaker built into the tailgate causes the interior tailgate to rattle horribly even when listening to something like [Name] at a very low volume and LEXUS REFUSES TO FIX IT.\n",
      "Sound system rattles even when playing low.\n",
      "Back tailgate rattles horribly with sound system on, even when playing low.\n",
      "Lexus advertises higher fuel economy when driving in Eco mode; however, I am always in Eco mode and cognizant of my efforts to manage my fuel economy, and yet, even in the city, my Eco fuel economy is lower than I was told to expect.\n",
      "The car is a comfortable ride, not peppy though.\n",
      "And when I plug in my phone to charge it, it disconnects the Bluetooth.\n",
      "My wife has a BMW sedan, and its trunk holds almost as much and in some ways is easier to use.\n",

      " had problem with rattling light in the back seat.\n",
      "The sensor is not a good idea.\n",
      "They do not turn off automatically when you lock your car.\n",
      "My child played with the sensor - turnining it on and off by hand-  and it rattles even since.\n",
      "Apr 17, 2016I purchased a Lexus because of reputation for reliability and comfort.\n",
      "I thought however it would have more standard features such as automated garage door opener, standard GPS, lane change warning, colission avoidance, built in compass etc.\n",
      "Needs more power, better fuel fuel economy, a completely new NAV/infotainment system, and a better stereo.\n",
      "In the age of iPhones, using the 2016 Lexus system feels like I am playing the original Nintendo video game system.\n",
      "Also, I consistently keep the green ECO light on by driving slowly and get 16 MPG in the city.\n",
      "Oct 23, 2016When playing certain music, I hear vibrations from the rear speakers.\n",
      "There is a significant blind spot in the right rear due to the head rest.\n",

      "Everything else I am very happy with, including fuel consumption, performance and reliability.\n",
      "One of the only things I miss from going from the RX to the NX is the power folding side mirrors!\n",
      "Please put power on the NX side mirrors!\n",
      "And ventilated seats would be nice too!\n",
      "My new NX200t provides easy access, is comfortable, provides surprisingly good economy and performance while remaining smooth and reasonably quiet.\n",

      "I've had four Lexus's prior to the RC 350 F-Sport and never had a uncomfortable experience with the diver side seat belt.\n",
      "The RC350 seat belt is  constrictive and pinches against the neck in a position that even the user manual states is not safe.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016The seat belt is cumbersome and tight on the neck.\n",
      "Very difficult to use while driving and is a major distraction due the sensitivity.\n",
      "I'm enjoying my driving experience, however there are two features that need to be improved before I would purchase another RC.\n",
      "First, i absolutely hate being forced to use the touch paid instead of the controllers used in the past.\n",
      "The touch paid is to sensitive and a major distraction while driving or trying to use the screen features.\n",
      "To make matters worse, the is no Lexus Enform internet video on the use of the touch pad control.\n",
      "Secondly, the seat belts do not live up to the usual Lexus standards.\n",

      "I couldn't get the garage door opener in the rear view mirror to work.\n",
      "It was a mistake to make the 2016 RX350 exterior wheel well a graphite material because it cheapens the look of the vehicle.\n",
      "The hands-free rear door is a joke.\n",

      "If they want maximum safety features to check out Honda models as our 2015 Honda has several safety features that our 2019 Lexus lack - but - our 2019 Lexus has one or two safety features our 2015 Honda does not have.\n",

      "The ride is GREAT for comfort.\n",
      "We constantly get nice comments about the styling and interior on our Lexus wherever we go.\n",
      "One bad thing is we had gotten slush-mud in our door jams which is something we have never experienced with any other new car we have owned.\n",
      "Not sure if it is the computer operation of the engine or the transmission.\n",
      "Loud, and the car's ride did not feel lux or what I know my previous two RXs drove like in the past.\n"

      "Minus - some minor annoyances - cup holders are inconvenient, no real center console to put junk (gum, lipgloss, phone, etc), armrest thing is weird and poorly designed (can't put it down when you have a cup with a straw in it, can't get your cup out of the cupholder if it is down); it has a lot more highway road noise than I was expecting, downsized and so have had to get used to a smaller car without a lot of trunk capacity.\n",

      "I had a Mazda 6 as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks, and my only regret was that I didn't purchase that vehicle instead - it was one of the most fun cars I've driven in a while (really good blend of quiet performance and fuel economy between sport and eco modes).\n",
      "While I like the peppiness of the CX-3, I am very disappointed in the extremely small leg room in the the back seats & the VERY small trunk.\n",
      "I strongly object to the inability to answer phone calls on the bluetooth while driving since I travel alone & drive long distances so my children check my safety by calling me at intervals along my trip!\n",

      "Mazda CX3 is an excellent balance of economical characteristics, style, performance, and features resulting in a superior value.\n",
      "The inside is a bit awkward and I can't reach the cup holder very well while driving, and if there's a cup in them don't even think about using the arm rest.\n",
      "The car is really loud while driving so prepare for screaming over road nose while on road trips.\n",
      "The cup holder placement is really bad, and the arm rest seems really flimsy and cheap.\n",
      "This CX3 should have electric adjustable seats, rain sensor wipers,and Day/Night sensor lights.It also needs better center console with better configurations.\n",
      "Nov 4, 2016Needs electric seats with lumbar support, automatic head lights and auto rain sensor wipers.\n",
      "The gas mileage is amazing, it's stylish and for looking small on the outside, it has so much room on the inside, and I am able to haul a lot of gear in the back.\n",
      "It also is really safe and the AC works amazing.\n",
      "Apr 16, 2016The car needs more front seat/driver storage.\n",
      "Moving the emergency brake to the floor would give slightly more space to put things on.\n",

      "Need to do something with the armrest/cup holders.\n",
      "Also the seat cushion could be more comfortable.\n",

      "Needs power seat control for drivers seat.\n",
      "Lacking storage space in front compartment and middle arm rest is lacking in design.\n",
      "Wish that they had a center console and better armrest.\n",
      "When I drove the CX-5, I found it to be a road responsive and comfortable car with many safety features that I felt were important as an older driver who mainly drives in local traffic to nearby stores and on the highways for interstate travel.\n",
      "I think the front passenger seat should have power controls on the Touring model and think the satellite radio should be included as a standard feature on this model.\n",
      "The satellite radio was on the audio source options list but was not highlighted.\n",
      "I love the vehicle and overall it serves my needs at this point in my life, I would suggest the CX9, it has more room I like the over all lines and definition of this vehicle, the interior is somewhat small, move the arm rest forward towards the dash, add some more compartment space, the radio seems to have a low output.\n",
      "Oct 8, 2018In the future please add more storage room in the front and move the arm compartment more forward.\n",
      "Very happy with the vehicle- good, practical, nice, luxurious interior.\n",
      "Only criticism is the engine power- don't feel like it has a lot of power.\n",
      "I think a brand new 2018 vehicle should come with Sirius XM radio, when you are paying the kind of money I paid.\n",
      "It's a luxury vehicle in every way except for the luxury brand name and price.\n",
      "One downside is advertised and actual gas mileage and there is really no need to use premium gas.\n",
      "Keep engineering great vehicles at great prices.\n",
      "Great ride, quiet and comfortable!\n",
      "Need to improve the control center to operate heat/AC.\n",
      "I hope that Apple play will be available soon and at a reasonable or free price to make my purchase of my perfect car.\n",
      "The vehicle could use a few more little storage spots.\n",
      "There's plenty of dead space to the lower left of the steering wheel to add a small coin drawer and another little storage spot could be on the passenger's side of the front center console.\n",
      "Reliability, styling, comfort, quietness, fuel efficiency Road trip from north Texas to southern Colorado and the CX-9 was excellent.\n",
      "Excellent power, handling, comfort and styling.\n",
      "I was surprised to find that the Mazda CX-9 Signature was more comfortable and fun to drive than my late model AWD Cadillac SRX4!\n",
      "Luxury feel w/o the premium price.\n",
      "Great value the leather is not holding up as expected and the infotainment system lags and is an annoyance.\n",
      "They are so fun to drive and they are like driving a luxury vehicle without the price tag.\n",
      "It is 2018 and Apple Carplay/Android Auto is not available.\n",
      "Good transmission for an automatic, great handling, acceptable ride for a sports-suspension, very good fuel economy, quite good power for a non-sports-car, a touch small, looks good without being gaudy.\n",
      "Could use a bit more storage space, especially enclosed storage space in the back for extra necessities like a first aid kit, cross-lug-wrench, air compressor, and some other roadside emergency/safety equipment.\n",
      "This has already caused me to get soda on my nice new seats - once a chocolate milkshake - and it was a PITA to clean.\n",
      "A long front piece that extends over the parking brake lever makes it unwieldy to open/close while belted into the driver's seat at a stoplight or similar.\n",
      "Seems to be a bug in the Bluetooth systemÃ¢ÂÂI can't use voice commands on the phone while connected to Bluetooth.\n",
      "The car could also use some more storage/organization in the hatch-back cargo area.\n",
      "For example, I have a cross-wrench, tire air compressor, snow chains, and a couple of other extra safety/maintenance items that I keep with me at all times, and there is no place to store some of it (especially the cross-wrench and compressor).\n",
      "Making room for extra confined storage in the spare tire space and around the wheel arches on the sides of the cargo area to stow this sort of item.\n",
      "The substitution of the manual transmission and the more powerful 2.5L engine makes the Mazda3 a worthy consideration to buyers considering a VW GTI, but put off by the GTI's poor reputation for quality.\n",
      "The interior styling is simple, elegant and sophisticated and miles better than the cheap feeling interior of Corollas and Focuses.\n",
      "As you drive the vehicle more, owners will appreciate small design touches such as the raised center home button for the infotainment system that allows easy, no-view actuation and the padded sides of the cupholder compartment that is a likely place to rest either a right hand or right arm.\n",
      "In a world in which formerly performance-oriented brands such as BMW have moved their vehicle designs away from performance and towards luxury, I appreciate Mazda maintaining its brand and product positioning focus on enthusiast drivers.\n",
      "My wife is not an enthusiast driver, but the steering and handling feel were a big part of her confidence when driving her new CX-5.\n",
      "And when using a smartphone (in my case, an Apple iPhone 6) as a music library, the scroll feature is absolutely horribleÃ¢ÂÂeither that I cannot understand your owner's manual.\n",
      "And don't suggest using voice command (i.e., \"play Zydeco Kings\"), for I'm unsure whether if it's the tech inside the iPhone that's the issue or if it's a Mazda thing, but the phone can never understand what I'm saying.\n",
      "For example, the handle on the front seat that adjusts height seems like it will eventually bend or break, and the material used around the steering wheel cowl is loose (feels like it's held in place with tape).\n",
      "The Mazda3 five door is a great little highway car.\n",
      "As equipped (grand touring), the steering, brakes, and driving features like adaptive cruise control make it easy to drive at speed and less stressful on long drives.\n",
      "drumming, and creaks, especially in the headliner, sunroof, and door seals.\n",
      "Make the front seats about two inches wider, especially the bottom part, and make at least the driver's seat bottom tilt.\n",
      "Make front passenger seat as adjustable as the driver's seat.\n",
      "Carpet the lower portion of the doors to eliminate shoe scuffing.\n",
      "Illuminate the steering wheel stalks.\n",
      "Use better (more comfortable) tires on the 18 inch wheels - the OEM Dunlops are terrible and are probably part of the squeak/rattle problem!\n",
      "The vehicle entertainment system really needs integration with SmartPhones like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, because the in-vehicle navigation is mediocre.\n",
      "I need a place to mount a cellphone so I can use apps like Google Maps or Waze for navigation all the time.\n",
      "Would also be nice to have a way to connect to USB ports in the dash instead of having to run a cable, which gets in the way, from the center console/armrest.\n",
      "I would also really like to see Android Auto/Apple CarPlay added to the CMS system in the car.\n",
      "It would be AWESOME if Mazda integrated these systems, since the wipers are automatic rain-sensing and the lights have an automatic setting as well.\n",
      "If the wipers sense rain, turn the wipers AND the lights on!\n",
      ":).\n",
      "The only issue I've noticed is in regards to the windows (all), mirrors, and air conditioning system.\n",
      "I have my phone plugged into my car constantly, and it would be amazing to be able to use the larger display for navigation rather than my phone.\n",
      "The USB ports that come standard on the vehicle are also not a high enough amperage to charge modern smartphones; I had to get a third-party charger to use with the accessory port in the center console armrest.\n",
      "The steering is a bit numb, but it handles beautifully.\n",
      "Power is balanced to great [Name] mileage.\n",
      "Interior and exterior are really quite lovely.\n",
      "My wife only will drive this or a VW Golf which is also very safe.\n",
      "My only criticisms on the car is the \"numbness\" of the steering and the lackluster acceleration.\n",
      "Nov 5, 2016Please tighten the steering so it is not so disconnected.\n",
      "Material that the front seats are made of feels very cheap.\n",
      "When I slide into the front seat the door side of the seat often pulls away from the seat frame.\n",
      "Spend the extra bit of money on the interior for the base models and it could be a perfect car.\n",
      "Entertainment system should allow touch screen capabilities while driving.\n",
      "Super little car, it just needs seats that remember driver's position.\n",
      "Apr 2, 2016I did a lot of research prior to choosing this car, and all it needs to be perfect are seats which positions can be programmed.\n",
      "Driver seat isn't the most comfortable sometimes on longer drives.\n",
      "For example, if my kids have any sunscreen residue on their hands when they close the doors it shows up on the handles and is hard to clean off.\n",
      "I love the Mazda3--handling, gas mileage, resale value.\n",
      "It does need more cupholders though, and I would have like to have a compass along with the outside temperature gauge...I like to know the direction I'm headed without the extra cost of having the navigation system...I do have that APP on my phone.\n",
      "True drivers are attracted to Mazda for performance and being fun-to-drive; the infotainment center is a distraction and I wish they would bring back controls you can navigate with touch, not taking your eyes off the road.\n",
      "If you view driving satisfaction and handling, then the Mazda3 is a good choice for modest money.\n",
      "The Mazda3 is a good vehicle that needs 100 more horsepower and AWD.\n",
      "Bluetooth subject to cutting out if in a pocket or generally not in the middle of vehicle, and USB tends to cut in and out as if there is a poor connection.\n",
      "The Mazda3 S Grand Touring with Tech Package met my expectations for a small, well-equipped, reliable, fun-to-drive hatchback.\n",
      "Not a luxury car, but very well equipped and designed, and I don't suffer by driving it.\n",
      "A great, reliable car that is fun to drive and economical.\n",
      "Bluetooth connection is spotty and seat materials not very good.\n",
      "Would like to be able to use the touchscreen while in motion.\n",
      "It's a real dependable vehicle with a lot of standard features and most of all its fun to drive and has great safety features as well.\n",
      "A navigation system should always be standard along with Bose speakers.\n",

      "Well equipped with safety features and infotainment, although it is missing CarPlay/Android Auto.\n",
      "Entry and exit at front seat can be a little tight but there is plenty of room on the inside.\n",
      "Would like to have CarPlay and an option for a more powerful engine.\n",
      "Its is solid reliable vehicle, good ride qualities.\n",
      "It lacks an engine temperature gauge and tire pressure gauge.\n",
      "Oct 14, 2016It would be nice if there was a screen to monitor engine systems like temperature and oil pressure.\n",
      "There is already a screen for other USELESS system information like outside temperature, various fuel usage.\n",
      "Aug 5, 2016more engine instrumentation - engine temperature gauge would be good.\n",
      "The car handles very well, but the ride can be a bit loud and harsh at times.\n",
      "I like the Mazdas that lean toward the performance side, while still able to be used as a daily driver.\n",
      "Mar 21, 2016One of the things that bugs me mostÃ¢ÂÂthough fairly minorÃ¢ÂÂis the position and depth of the cupholders in the front between the driver/passenger seats.\n",
      "The cupholders are located in a position where a cup any larger than a soda can or small bottle make it difficult to reach the controls for the audio/navigation system.\n",
      "The system is a poor option, and it does not allow support for Apple or Android's far superior systems.\n",
      "The car itself is fun to drive, highly rated for safety, is not just another Honda Accord on the road, and gives you a feeling of control, but their tech needs a serious upgrade.\n",
      "Before I had no issues, but now there are things like Pandora will require that I allow permission on my phone for the car to use the Pandora App, which seems tedious.\n",
      "If you want a car with great overall styling, aggressive new design, technologically advanced with safety features, great fuel economy and super fun to drive, Mazda 6 is for you!\n",
      "The kodo design is simply beautiful and makes the car lineup luxurious and premium, without the premium price tag.\n",
      "Some minor improvements on the infotainment system, and perhaps offering different engine types would be great.\n",
      "Pressing a little harder on the gas does not signal the transmission to downshift like most other transmissions.\n",
      "I find myself using the manual shift mode often if I am going up a hill and have situations when I have to let off the gas.\n",
      "I wish there were a slightly smaller tire/wheel size that would give a smoother, quieter ride, with a little higher sidewall to guard against wheel and tire damage.\n",
      "I would like to see Mazda make car more quiet with a bit more sound insulation for highway cruising.\n",
      "The infotainment system is just meh, give us CarPlay/android auto already.\n",
      "Let us use the touchscreen while driving.\n",
      "Give me a option for a manual Grand Touring, and more powerful engine.\n",
      "May 7, 2016The cars infotainment system should be touch screen all the time, the command knob is a bit confusing while driving.\n",
      "It has a lot of interesting/fun technology inside included and the interior looks good inside.\n",
      "It appears to be light and not very heavy when handling.\n",
      "The wheels are too dark for the white exterior.\n",
      "Would like to have the wheels with a lighter steel/silver color.\n",
      "They moved the push start button to a high part of the dash,  It is in direct sunlight when parked outside, on hot days, the button gets hot, and is sometime too hot to push with your finger.\n",
      "My Mazda 6 is good looking, comfortable, fun to drive, and a good value.\n",
      "Wish the doors sounded more solid on closing.\n",
      "These sounds detract from sense of luxury that would be nice to have.\n",
      "Mazda6: Bold in style, elegant to drive, and it's absolute beauty all together.\n",
      "Disappointed that an annoying rattle developed in the left rear passenger door after just a couple of months.\n",
      "In my opinion, the driver's seat is uncomfortable and not wide enough, and does not have enough adjustments to allow for a comfortable driving position.\n",
      "Very fun to drive and driver assist tech is effective and enhances both safety and enjoyment.\n",
      "Enhance the infortainment controls and content, and some of the Air heating and cooling controls and this would be a great contender against higher priced lines.\n",
      "Otherwise great sightlines inside and out, comfort and handling abound.\n",
      "The Honda Civics and Accords have more of a technical features for a better price.\n",
      "As for my daughter having to chose between the Mazda 3 hatch back or the Civic with all the tech stuff at a better quality of tech.\n",
      "At night time, there is reflection on the front windshield, principally from the navigation/entertainment screen.\n",
      "Also engine noise is significant and sounds like a sewing machine or something that I'm really not used to hearing.\n",
      "The safety features are outstanding!\n",
      "From the interior to the driving dynamics, you'll notice the difference.\n",
      "Make the great safety features available in all models.\n",
      "Mar 22, 2016I think one touch that was missing was to have LED lighting inside the cupholder bin in the center console.\n",
      "When blocking windows that the children did not open, I cannot open them without unlocking.\n",
      "The one improvement I would suggest is road noise impedes ability to be heard while using car Bluetooth audio!\n",
      "With windows closed, radio off, and a/c on low fan.\n",
      "When you are used to using your iPhone, Siri, and Google Maps, you begin to expect greater capability.\n",
      "It is great although for the price I figured it would have come with more functions like remote start or heated seats.\n",
      "The only little complaint I have is the buttons on the homelink on the mirror are not lighted at night.\n",
      "Mazda could have integrated the exhaust pipes in the rear bumper better.\n",
      "For a four-cylinder engine, it provides plenty of power.\n",
      "Improving the GPS and the engine would make it perfect.\n",
      "Look into adding CarPlay and Android Auto and if the Infotainment system is actually upgradable, let older models upgrade to it.\n",
      "This car is comfortable and fun to drive.\n",
      "It is pleasing to look at and has the latest safety features.\n",
      "Reliability is high and fuel economy is great.\n",
      "The thing I like the least about the car are the seat adjustment mechanism and options.\n",
      "I would have liked cooled seats as well.\n",
      "Also, the rearview mirror should dim more when headlights are behind you.\n",
      "Gray wheels are boring.\n",
      "No traffic display in LA means having to use second device - now that's a safety issue!\n",
      "I am very pleased with the performance, ride, and look of the car.\n",
      "I love my new Mazda6, with one exception: the heater; it takes longer than it should to heat the interior.\n",
      "It has technology that makes it fun and keeps me safe.\n",
      "The software that drives the Entertainment System is still buggy.\n",
      "Extremely satisfied with quality and performance!\n",
      "Seats are comfortable!\n",
      "I love my Mazda6 except for the engine and road noise.\n",
      "Great power, rides nice, good gas mileage.\n",
      "The club version is what a true driver is going to buy; however, it would be nice if there were at least the option to have a few creature comforts in it like heated seats.\n",
      "Little changes inside would be great like having a flat bottomed steering wheel.\n",
      "The arm wrest is of no use as it sits down too low.\n",
      "The passenger seat is sort of joke as well because of how the floor pushes into the spot your legs/feet would go.\n",
      "Love the size of the trunk though as opposed to older versions of the Miata and the outside styling is awesome!\n",
      "First is automatic climate control that is measured in degrees as opposed to the simple dials in the car now.\n",
      "The other is making the headlights automatically come on and off, depending upon the exterior darkness.\n",
      "I know the lights will turn off automatically if I walk away from the car, but all my other cars have the auto feature and it is hard to keep track.\n",
      "Third is the locking system on the door.\n",
      "I guess I need to read the manual, but when the car is locked, I find it confusing to figure out how to unlock the passenger door from the outside.\n",
      "Usually I have to walk around the car, open the driver's door then press unlock for the passenger's side,.\n",
      "Two major complaints about the car: (1) the steering wheel does not tilt upward to allow easy exit, and (2) there is no trunk release button in the interior portion of the car.\n",
      "Since, there is a keyless ignition, my key was in my purse which was in the trunk.\n",
      "Fortunately, the battery on the remote was good enough for me to start up my car to return home to get the other key to unlock my trunk.\n",
      "The seat adjustment lever is really, really fragile.\n",
      "I move my seat back when I exit and I know that one of these days, it will break.\n",
      "This is my third Miata and I love it, with the following exceptions:\r\n",
      "1) The driver's seat is very uncomfortable - my 2004 Miata was great.\n",
      "5) Why doesn't it have a rear camera?\n",
      "6) Navigation system limited by safety rules - can't do much while driving.\n",
      "MX-5 is delightful performance car but should come with factory installed back-up camera, especially due to low seating and generally poor rear visibility.\n",
      "GT trim level should include better side bolstering on seats.\n",
      "Navigation system is unsatisfactory and of marginal use; much faster and  more intuitive  technology is available on a simple smart phone (this is a big disappointment and makes car feel cheap).\n",
      "The 16 inch wheels and tires provide a much quieter and comfortable ride than the 17 inch.\n",
      "The smaller wheels still provide plenty of traction for lively cornering during everyday driving.\n",
      "If only someone could convince the car magazines that large diameter wheels with thin profile tires may provide higher performance numbers, but are not optimal for everyday driving.\n",
      "May 2, 201616 inch wheels, the most comfortable, are only available on the base model.\n",
      "It would be nice to have them as an option on the top level model as a concession to ride comfort.\n",
      "The vehicle MUST have back up camera.\n",
      "Headrest speakers are awful.\n",
      "Oct 14, 2016The vehicle needs a back up camera !!\n",
      "You cannot see behind you in this vehicle because of the high head rests and the center partition wind block screen   I would have paid extra for  rear camera.\n",
      "It NEEDS a back up camera.\n",
      "The seats are so low and the headrests and air vent are so high, you cannot see behind you when you turn your head.\n",
      "Also the speakers in the seat headrests vibrate sound at louder volumes.\n",
      "I want a vehicle with great performance, looks good and has a fantastic interior.\n",
      "When you drive you spend all of your time inside the vehicle, why not have a great looking comfortable leather interior.\n",
      "Not useful for long trips but a fun road car to drive.\n",
      "Seats too narrow, accessories unreachable, passenger area uncomfortable.\n",
      "Seats are too small for wider adults.\n",
      "No lumbar support.\n",
      "Minimal accessible storage for things like glasses, CD's etc.\n",
      "It's a terrific car--reliable, economical, comfortable and super fun to drive.\n",
      "Still the most fun to drive, the new 2016 Miata has all the other creature comforts (navigation, location warnings, wifi, etc.\n",
      "The style is great the interior more roomy; all the helpful technology is available.\n",
      "After 1,000 miles the car has proven to be reliable and solid performer.\n",
      "I wish it had back up sensors or reverse camera.\n",
      "If you are after a sporty fun-to-drive reasonably priced sports car the MX-5 is an excellent choice.\n",
      "Disappointed that the MX-5 did not have a backup camera and a individual digital tire pressure warning/indicating feature.\n",
      "It gets good mileage and works great for pleasure driving as well as round-town travel.\n",
      "Allow older cars to upgrade software to Android Auto and other new applications.\n",
      "Really should have a backup camera.\n",
      "The lane keeping system should be able to be shut off totally, as it doesn't really work right.\n",
      "Not sure if its the nature of the vehicle and less sound deadening, but I hear a lot more noises in this car and not sure if it is correct or is an issue.\n",
      "Mazdas are reliable and fun to drive.\n",
      "Otherwise, you can tell what's real exhaust noise and what's piped in, which is annoying.\n",
      "Oct 24, 2016Need spare tire option, need a white interior option, a red sports car looks great with white leather interior.\n",
      "A backup camera and telescoping steering wheel are a must!\n",
      "I understand that there may not be a spare tire due to space, however not having a jack or wheel wrench is extreme.\n",
      "Mazda--great reliability, great fun, great value.\n",
      "Powerful engine for my needs.\n",
      "I feel very connected to it while driving.\n",
      "Driver's seat would be improved by better, firmer padding.\n",
      "I do not like the tires because of the run-flat tires are too stiff for a comfortable ride (not because BMW does it, doesn't mean they are the best and I don't like stiff rides).\n",
      "Put a dipstick on the automatic transmission and stop trying to bring customers in the dealerships to extract money from them by charging an arm and a leg with just for consultation repair or oil change.\n",
      "Have the navigational system part of the sale, option to get only the LED headlights.\n",
      "I saw the space for the spare tire at the trunk and there is no space for it on the tire well.\n",
      "Why have amber rear turn signal bulbs, when it isn't being used.\n",
      "Why can't the car owner order power rear window and side window sunshade optional after sale service?\n",
      "Why is there a need to buy a panoramic sunroof with the rear car roof having light opening?\n",
      "Why not make all headlights for it with the eyebrow LED for daytime running light, while my model has a LED daytime running light below the main beams?\n",
      "This noise/harmonics should have been caught during engineering development.\n",
      "Even more economical entry-level vehicles have this feature, which is an important factor in vehicle safety.\n",
      "For a luxury car, I am not impressed that this is not standard feature when it says the vehicle has Bluetooth.\n",
      "Mercedes has truly missed the ball on this key safety feature.\n",
      "I should be able to hit the phone button on the steering wheel and say call mom, to be a hands-free Bluetooth system.\n",
      "Good example of poor info display design: checking tire pressure while underway.\n",
      "It must be accessed via the steering wheel buttons and is down the menu tree about four levels, all of which must be navigated while driving.\n",
      "This means I will need to replace both front tires at about 11Ã¢ÂÂ12K of mileage or just about the amount of mileage I drive in a year.\n",
      "It does not come with a navigation system at all, it does not have a CD player, and it does not have parking sensors in the front which are needed due to the low level of ground clearance regarding parking spots While my particular vehicle is fun to drive, It appears to me that Mercedes was being cheap about the accessories on the vehicle.\n",
      "I was not told that it did not have a CD player which I did not notice, I was not aware it didn't have front parking sensors which are needed due to the concrete parking stops with the low clearance of the vehicle, and there was absolutely no navigation system in the vehicle.\n",
      "They want you to use your smartphone or spend an additional $2500 for a navigation system I haven't had a new vehicle in recent years that did not come with the navigation system,  it appears to me that Mercedes was not aware it didn't have front parking sensors which are needed due to the concrete parking stops in the low clearance of the vehicle absolutely no navigation system in the vehicle.\n",
      "The C 450 is fast, responsive, comfortable, and has the latest safety features and technology.\n",
      "(1) The leather seats indicated they would be perforated in the leather package.\n",
      "They are not.\n",
      "The ride would be a lot smoother if the tires had more meat on them, especially in New York City driving (potholes!!!).\n",
      "Oct 16, 2016I LOVE the headlights and the LED taillights on this baby!\n",
      "Thank you for discontinuing that ridiculous driving lights/signal lights switchback system.\n",
      "I am glad this C300 did NOT have that switchback signal system, the one that switches OFF the daytime driving lights when the signal lights were turned on in the daytime.\n",
      "And my only complaint is the hard thumps on the rear wheels when you hit the slightest bumps in the street OR highway!\n",
      "It should ride smoother in the rear, as in the front.\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016Thank you MERCEDES-BENZ for leaving the daytime driving lights and the signal lights on separate circuits!\n",
      "I hate that system where the daytime driving lights went OFF when you use the (amber) signal lights!\n",
      "I love the backup camera, but wish it also had beeping sonar.\n",
      "The steering is a bit light in comfort and feels a bit artificial (my guess is due to it being electric and not hydraulic maybe?).\n",
      "The handling is excellent, fuel economy is excellent.\n",
      "If the standard headlights and sound system were better, it would be a solid 9/10.\n",
      "It is one of the best-designed and highest-quality interiors of any vehicle I have ever seen or owned.\n",
      "None of the technology or the engineering of the w205 is innovative.\n",
      "The Command system I find difficult to use and defective from the knobs in the center to the steering wheel controls.\n",
      "The climate control has a terribly difficult design to use and is also very distracting when simply trying to turn on the air while driving.\n",
      "Controls in the interior should be quick and simple, not a slow, highly customizable, glitchy, difficult to use computer!\n",
      "The interior is made of cheap parts that feel like they can be torn out with a pinky finger.\n",
      "I am a little frustrated by the Bluetooth option on my stereo.\n",
      "Although I am the principle user, we usually use my wife's mobile for music.\n",
      "Seat adjustment is greatÃ¢ÂÂlike the one touch adjustment between drivers.\n",
      "The trunk closing sounds \"tinny,\" which cheapens the overall effect of the carÃ¢ÂÂcould be the license plate holder.\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016I find some of the technology a little awkwardÃ¢ÂÂthe Bluetooth synchronization with my phone or others in the cabin, always takes several minutes to complete and normally had one of use having to switch off Bluetooth.\n",
      "Wonderful driving experience, a great balance between handling performance and comfort.\n",
      "This is the first car I've had that remains comfortable for extended driving.\n",
      "One of two complaints: many of the options available need to be bundled with other options (for example to get the led headlights, it must be bundled with a  $2200 option of items I didn't value that much).\n",
      "Yes, please make better safety features standard on your vehicles, air bags are great if you are in a crash, but better vehicle safety features could prevent that crash, and please move the radio tuner.\n",
      "Apr 27, 2016The radio station wheel for the radio is in a dumb place.\n",
      "The phone system does not have voice capability, and if you need to make a call, it is necessary to pull over and just dial the phone rather than take your eyes off the road to use the phone system in the vehicle.\n",
      "It is fun to drive but not powerful.\n",
      "The MB faux leather seats rather than actual leather are great.\n",
      "Apr 23, 2016While the C 300 is fun to drive, the BMW has more power and is more fun while driving.\n",
      "The back seat is just barely too small/ impractical for adults.\n",
      "All-wheel drive is not fuel-efficient on this model.\n",
      "The navigation system, especially the wholly unused touchpad, should be removed until a better system can be found--perhaps Siri or Google Assistant.\n",
      "The voice and translation used with the English assistant are irritating.\n",
      "Would rather have the shifting of the car on the floor than on the wheel.\n",
      "Don't actually like the shifting on the wheel and don't like the push button into park.\n",
      "Do not the gear shift on the wheel, prefer it on the floor.\n",
      "I get very confused going from my wife's car to my car, because I am more used to my car now, so that I put on her wipers when I am trying to shift her car.\n",
      "I was surprised that the vehicle was not equipped with an automatic trunk closer and with a remote engine starter.\n",
      "(The smartphone version is not as convenient as placement on the key fob.)\n",
      "I was disappointed that the vehicle was not equipped with automatic braking.\n",
      "And the back seat is simply not very comfortable for long drives.\n",
      "I love the car's appearance, performance, and (given its luxury nature) the price.\n",
      "The 2019 AMG C43 provides the best balance of performance, luxury and versatility for the price on the market today.\n",
      "It goes from a luxurious, technological, weekday cruiser, in Comfort mode to a mad animal ready to take on a fun road or track at the flip of a switch in Sport Plus.\n",
      "I owned a W203 C55 for 7 years and until now that was the best car i've ever owned and I feel one of the best values of all time for its dichotomy of performance and luxury.\n",
      "The sound system is fine, but the Bluetooth feature is of poor sound quality.\n",
      "Too many same controls for the electronic system - touch pad, dash switch, and multi function knob?\n",
      "This is a beautiful small-midsize luxury vehicle at an affordable price point, with many great features that have been incorporated, which were previously on the upper models.\n",
      "If you have a back problem, then you MUST drive a Mercedes-Benz, as it has a brake hold feature which functions like no other at the moment!\n",
      "Haven't been able to get used to it as well as I'd like, but causes me to put it down several gears at times because it has to catch up.\n",
      "The only thing someone might want to consider is that all-season tires only come if you buy the 18\" wheels.\n",
      "The larger 19\" wheels only come with summer performance run flat tires.\n",
      "I was shocked to find that my 2016 C 300 sound system was not as high performing as my previous 2008 C 300.\n",
      "I expected the best quality of sound as a standard for Mercedes Benz in general.\n",
      "I had been driving MB cars since 2003, so I honestly had total faith in the sound system until about a month ago.\n",
      "MB C 450 is a great car for those who are looking for a midpoint between traditional Mercedes luxury and comfort and Mercedes-AMG performance.\n",
      "It does not have the earth-shaking power that Mercedes-AMG vehicles have, but it fills the gap in between with other features that Mercedes-AMG vehicles don't offer such as a performance AWD system.\n",
      "However, the fit and finish, especially around the door bottoms and the carpeting around the center console, are not up to my standards.\n",
      "Additionally, the cruise control does not seem well adapted to the four-cylinder engine.\n",
      "I like the colors of the interior and exterior.\n",
      "comfortable seats and ride, and very little road noise.\n",
      "Location of levers on steering column was bit confusing at first.\n",
      "Outside rear view somewhat impaired unless headrests are folded down.\n",
      "There is a pretty steep learning curve in using all the features this car has.\n",
      "Hesitation when accelerating from a stop is significant, not enough room for older persons (70+) to get in/out.\n",
      "Hand controls are repetitive and not user-friendly when driving I don't understand why I have to choose between practicality and luxury when it comes to basic features like the spare tire.\n",
      "However, I don't use the navigation system because I'm unable to figure out how it works, and I don't take the time to read the manual or view the videos, which would be helpful, I'm sure.\n",
      "It's sporty, yet has all of the luxury one needs, plus not only do I feel safe, but I know my passengers are, too.\n",
      "Great features/comfort/technology for the price.\n",
      "Should be able to turn off the stop-engine economy feature permanently, more clearance required between seat and steering well for ease of entry.\n",
      "Mar 28, 2016I've seen vehicles equipped with a steering wheel that is flat on the bottom.\n",
      "I would like that feature in my C 300 to provide more legroom when entering the vehicle.\n",
      "Fun to drive, reliable, quiet.\n",
      "The most up to date safety features & technology.\n",
      "Very comfortable interior.\n",
      "Stop-start technology is annoying when driving in city traffic.\n",
      "Lane keeping assist is a good feature & has forced me to use my turn signals more.\n",
      "The features that were on my need list that are missing make driving this car less fun...luxury brand missing some key features that are standard on almost all vehicles now (hands free calling).\n",
      "Nicest car I have ever owned, but the lack of cooled seats and parking radar is sad for a \"luxury\" car.\n",
      "You need to add cooled seats and parking radar.\n",
      "Apr 14, 2016Radar sensors should be standard.\n",
      "Also, the seat cooling should also be standard with seat heating (my butt is never cold, but frequently warm while driving).\n",
      "Great engine, superb gearbox, great handling with 4-wheel drive.\n",
      "2 complaints: the outside door handles feel plastic & flimsy; and I would trade the sunroof for full leather seats.\n",
      "The engine is annoyingly noisy, which I was told after purchasing and driving the car, that the knocking noise is normal and not repairable.\n",
      "The placement of the lever controls on the steering column are so poorly placed that cruise control and the directional light control are easily confused.\n",
      "Worse, it uses a remote start system that rarely works at the first try and then only repeatable twice before becoming disabled.\n",
      "I had been driving Volvos for nearly 2 million miles and found them very satisfactory but became disappointed when they sold their brand and made the car more difficult to repair and costly to repair and less reliable.\n",
      "With fewer than 6,000 miles on the tires, I've had to stop 4x to put air in tires after crossing a bridge and road bump where the connection is not level.\n",
      "Even all the way down the headrest is too high.\n",
      "The performance exhaust is exciting and the horsepower/torque/acceleration is exhilarating.\n",

      "The two problems were actually two general areas: The GPS and the Sound System.\n",
      "Every new model of the E350 reflected the dedication to improve and expand all driving functions, especially for me, the GPS and Sound System.\n",
      "It seems that the designers of this car did not know, or even take the slightest interest, absolutely not the slightest interest, in seeing what the GPS facilities and the Sound System facilities of the E350 were!!!\n",
      "So now, to find out how the GPS wants to route me, I have to fool around with the map while I'm driving.\n",
      "Regarding the GPS, I know my routes pretty much already, but I must say that using the GPS to test alternate routes - because you can no longer explore the map conveniently - has become burdensome, no longer practical, and no longer the pleasure and source of great fun I had with all 3 generations of the E350 and the C350 before them.\n",
      "First of all - to say something that is nice - the quality of the Sound is nowhere short of amazing.\n",
      "The problem with the wonderfully refined detailed quality of the sound is that those qualities are drowned out by the astonishingly loud cabin noise while driving even above 45 MPH.\n",
      "The less deluxe sound of the E350, excellent itself and loved by me through 3 generations, would have overcome the noise better.\n",
      "Now I have to raise the sound to unpleasant levels to hear my music through the noise.\n",
      "The noise level in the Chevy Malibu we recently rented is so much lower than in my E300 that people in the back seat can hear what's being said in the front.]\n",
      "I have my music stored on my thumb drive using a nested directory structure.\n",
      "Now I have to use my phone, or tricks I can use to fool the system to go where I want it to go.\n",
      "So instead of being able to choose anything I might want to listen to from more music than you could listen to if you walked across the whole country, I have to prepare in advance, on my phone, what I might want to listen to on a 6+ hour trip,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "pullover to the shoulder if I wanted to play something else, or fumble with my phone WHILE DRIVING to choose the music I wanted to listen to.\n",
      "Oct 28, 2016Although the driving experience is dramatically improved over the already excellent E350, greater wind noise, above 55MPH, interferes with hearing the superb new sound system.\n",
      "Unfortunately, my experience with the GPS and Music Management System, some shortcomings confirmed by contact with the help service, has been disheartening.\n",
      "It seems that the program of improving the GPS and Music Management System that was wonderful in the E350 - the improvements that made me instantly forget that I didn't want to give up the previous 3 editions  - has been abandoned for the E300.\n",
      "Instead of building on the E350, the E300 seems to be designed from scratch without regard for many of the outstanding facilities of the GPS and none of the facilities of the Music Management System.\n",
      "Now the GPS is primitive compared to the E350 and the Music Management System is simply useless.\n",
      "Get the active seats, they make long trips a joy!\n",
      "Dec 9, 2016Since the vehicle settings are all program settings, please make it possible for the dealership to personalize some things like the start-stop preference and transmission mode preferences and backup camera view to make them the owners default settings.\n",
      "And would you please program a button to turn on the cameras at low speeds without selecting reverse?\n",
      "My previous E320 had two cargo hooks in the trunk, and I used both of them a lot.\n",
      "I wanted a specific color interior, but couldn't get it with the other options I wanted.\n",
      "I wanted optional wheels but couldn't get them with the other options I wanted.\n",

      "More important, as a busy manager, I love all the connectively features and quietness of the ride which allows me to be so productive on the road.\n",
      "I would like to see commercials that stress the fact that for a four-door sedan, the car is sportier than most cars in its class, yet it offers incredible creature comfort and technology.\n",
      "When people ask me what is it like to drive the Mercedes, I say it is like sitting in a luxurious lounger that is strapped to a rocket.\n",
      "That said, now that I am able to use Apple CarPlay, I just use Siri, who is just awesome!\n",
      "I like itÃ¢ÂÂgreat ride, great driving car.\n",
      "This is my first 4-cylinder car, and I'm happy with the performance but don't much care for the engine sound.\n",
      "Kind of sounds like a diesel.\n",
      "Use my iPhone through CarPlay instead.\n",
      "I never use the Mercedes nav unless the destination is already in it, as in my home or office.\n",
      "This new model just feels and looks cheap compared to earlier designs.They put a lot of new technology into the car, maybe too much, because It appears they sacrificed interior and exterior design and overall luxury to keep the retail price down.\n",
      "The interior styling of the E300 is unbelievably gorgeous and, in my opinion, nicer than an S-Class.\n",
      "The only down side is the 4 cylinder engine and exterior styling that looks too much like a C-Class.\n",
      "If you're spending more than $60k on a vehicle, it should at least have 6 cylinders and more power than a car costing half as much.\n",
      "I would like to have the backup camera protected from obscuration in bad weather, a more visible center console storage button, a more user friendly navigation system, easier to program satellite radio stations, an overhead light switch that is easier to see in the dark, and better response to telephone voice commands.\n",

      "Using a hood holder stick for Mercedes is a shame.\n",
      "But there are always cool features of previous vehicles you wish you still had:  rear headrests folded down at push of button so rear veil wasn't blocked, programmable garage door entry, molded winter mats(standard w vehicle)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The glove compartment on the GLA is too small.\n",
      "You also can't leave the seat warmers on and have them turn in remotely.\n",
      "Would be cozy to sit on a warm seat on a cold day.\n",
      "internal driver assistance system is not up to snuff...rides hard...is somewhat noisy...comfortable seats...excellent fit and finish...wonderful power...ergonomics need work...clunky at low speeds in snow (transmission)...needs heads up display...needs ventilated seats...poor ingress/egress...noisy tires.\n",
      "A few extra considerations could have been added to make this vehicle perfect...ie option of ventilated seats and heads up display...more work on nav/driver assistance systems...quieter...heating cooling system too low on dash (dangerous)...cannot get to driver assistance system controller when using cup holders.\n",
      "My leg hits driver assistance control system while driving.\n",
      "Dec 9, 2016Great car!...Very fast...Navigation system somewhat rudimentary and not the best I have seen...Very good seats.\n",
      "I love the power it packs and how responsive it is when it comes time to pass someone on the highway or accelerate quickly.\n",
      "However, what I cannot get used to and strongly dislike is the harsh downshifting once I remove my foot off the accelerator.\n",
      "I expected superior quality when it came to Mercedes so the fact that the transmission is so jerky at speeds that are common for most commuters, I spend a lot of time double thinking my decision to lease this vehicle.\n",
      "I figured out when I was driving that my view was obstructed by the cargo area cover.\n",
      "I then realized I had to push it down because I had a car seat in the back that had pushed it up the day before.\n",
      "The door doesn't close then.\n",
      "I'm also worried I'm going to lock myself out of the car with the monkey system, and I'm also worried that the key battery will go dead.\n",
      "As it stands, this navigation system is not intuitive, difficult to use and is very far behind all other technology in other lower regarded brands.\n",
      "This is not available, unless a key is inside, I really wish I could leave the car running and lock the door.\n",
      "The door does not always respond to the key being next to it, same thing for locking the car, with the touch pad on the door handle.\n",
      "Apr 3, 2016The windows are set in a way that I have to turn my entire body to look behind me and see my blind spot.\n",
      "However after driving a while now, the engine noise is unacceptable.\n",
      "When there is rain or washing my car - water gets into EVERY door opening in the back and sides, and even after drying, water leaks out and leaves water marks along the doors, rear.\n",
      "Overall, I love my GLA, however, the interior headspace is very low and I hate the \"fuel saving\" on and off feature, the car hesitates too long to take off quickly.\n",
      "I had to get used to the frequency with which I pump gas, moving from the Lexus hybrid to gas only as well as to the sound of the car.\n",
      "As a manufacturing you need to ensure connectivity issues do not happen when purchasing a car at the price of a Mercedes.\n",
      "My daughter has a Honda and the functionality of linking phone and car is automatic, no cable to connect.\n",
      "Also, I find that the navigation system is somewhat challenging and slightly frustrating to use.... once the destination is entered, the volume is often times hard to hear when the radio is on....\n",
      "Both the lane change detection systems are inferior.\n",
      "Mar 1, 2016Technology is not user friendly, the lane change alert is Inferior to my Genesis car...Very disappointed in the tech in my Mercedes and how difficult and non-user friendly it is...\n",
      "The vehicle is safe, looks great, nicely done on the inside, handles well, has extra capacity because the seats fold down, stands out from the other brands in a good way, with great features.\n",
      "Jun 3, 2016You might consider better lighting for the control panel, hard to see in the dark, while driving.\n",
      "The biggest regret I have is the passenger seat.\n",
      "I over looked the passenger seat functionality when I purchased this vehicle.\n",
      "The secondary feature that I am not impressed with is the sunroof filter cloth used, in California it does not insulate the intense heat from the glass roof.\n",
      "very solid and safe feeling and a real blast to drive in a spirited manner.\n",
      "you should have made it possible to slide the sun visor toward the rear when it is rotated to the side window.\n",
      "Nav is lacking in performance.\n",
      "Too much torque steer.\n",
      "Automatic folding mirrors and remote start would help this vehicle in its target market.\n",
      "Improve the quality of the ride.\n",
      "Passenger seat blocks you view if your want to check parallel traffic.\n",
      "His /her knees would be pushing against the back of the front seats.\n",
      "My new vehicle is smaller than the SUV models (ML 350) I had been driving but much more comfortable that the GLA250.\n",
      "I love my car but to not have an electric passenger seat is a cheap out in my opinion.\n",
      "It is a very comfortable and well-performing vehicle.\n",
      "The door lock pulls on the top of the door are annoying.\n",
      "Good design safe and reliable.\n",
      "A good buy and a car that delivers a good and fun ride well worth the money.\n",
      "The convenience package should be standard as well as the remote entry.\n",
      "The versatility of the interior seating/space is terrific.\n",
      "Great overall -- functional, great styling, drives great.\n",
      "I wish that it came with remote start and a heated steering wheel.\n",
      "Rear seat should be on more on a slanted position.\n",
      "Oct 28, 2016It is ridiculous that you omitted the garage door opener.\n",
      "Mercedes quality, affordable price.\n",
      "Outstanding quality and fun to drive.\n",
      "It rides comfortably, it handles well, it's incredibly responsive even in ECO mode, it's very quiet, and it rarely feels like you are driving an SUV (a type of vehicle I swore I'd never drive let alone own).\n",
      "I don't have a lot of bells and whistles, but they include Blind Spot Assist, Panorama Sunroof (not really a great addition for me), Surround Sound (nice but not that much noticeably better than the standard in our 2016 E-Class), Heated Front Seats (not critical here in the southern US), Premium Package, and Multimedia Package (I use the navigation more than I thought I would but compared to the navigation on the 2016 Audi Q5, it's lacking).\n",
      "Substantial is an over-wrought \"infotainment\" system what with way too many ways to perform simple to complex operations and the placement of the dial and touchpad where you can jump forward a track on your music while turning the dial to change distance in navigation.\n",
      "There are many, many things I like (if not love) about itÃ¢ÂÂthe biggest being that it handles, rides, and sounds like a sedan or station wagon and not a crossover/SUV.\n",
      "My quibbles are:\r\n",
      "1) a lack of options when using my iPhone for music through the Bluetooth system and/or\r\n",
      "2) a lack of clear instructions on how to change options through the system (if available) vs. using the iPhone (for example, switching from songs to artist to genre...).\n",
      "4) the immediate proximity of the mBrace button (and others) to the sunglasses bin as I hit that button at least once a month when reaching up for my sunglasses.\n",
      "6) the gas mileage isn't horrible for a vehicle this size and weight but even with my very conservative driving, it is disappointing.\n",
      "It may well be the features I'd like to access when using my iPhone for music are to be found on the Mercedes media programs, but I can't find them (intuitively) nor can I find that information in the on-line manual.\n",
      "An example is being able to use controls on the MB system to change playlists or to switch to shuffle play.\n",
      "I have to use my phone instead which is distracting while driving (so I don't use the phone and switch when I'd like to).\n",
      "REAL quality & status is \"surprise and delight\" customer handling and a product the impresses more each day you drive it.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016The GLC has some good qualities: power, engine, drivetrain, basic design, interior styling.\n",
      "The interior styling and quality is very high; however, the design and layout of controls is VERY POORLY designed...the steering wheel stalks poorly placed...fear of not knowing if it's in gear or not, console is useless...style over function.\n",
      "Run-flat tires are an expensive joke that should NEVER be put on any passenger car...rough choppy ride, horribly expensive to buy.\n",
      "FINALLY, THE ABSOLUTELY WORST FEATURES OF THIS CAR: the audio/NAV/infotainment is the worst I have ever used in any car.\n",
      "The sound quality is good and display doesn't wash out in full sun.\n",
      "Poor design, cheap tacky iPad stuck on a dash looks like Pep Boys aftermarket, very poor and confusing controls that don't work well.\n",
      "This is a new 2016 state-of-the-art car design (I thought) that I paid $thousands extra for and has NO Android Auto or CarPlay, no seek/search tuning functions, voice controls that are so unreliable that they are a waste of time to use, useless touch pad/wheel input that gets in the way of each other, NAV system that is so cumbersome to program that I don't bother...use my mobile phone NAV instead.\n",
      "My guess is your marketing nannies and sales people are now in control and design to be \"hip and cool\" instead of well engineered, and have destroyed what once was always ahead of the class in engineering and quality.\n",
      "Jun 24, 2016I strongly dislike several features of this vehicle, they are ruining the ownership experience for me:\r\n",
      " (1) design, features, specs, user friendliness of audio/nav systemÃ¢ÂÂHORRIBLE, HORRIBLE; (2) run-flat tiresÃ¢ÂÂruin the driving experience; (3) choppiness, bucking, kickback suspension over certain roadsÃ¢ÂÂnot the locked down feel of previous Mercedes.\n",
      "Nav system should have option to auto change time zone times.\n",
      "Improve rear seat legroom (width between front seat rails).\n",
      "Helpful to have the display pod adjustable for up and down and settable with memory, bifocals).\n",
      "Passenger seat heat and position adjustment reachable from drivers seat (useful to change for elderly passenger).\n",
      "NAV: I expected for the price it would have at least the features available on the Garmin handheld, such as listing of stop time, moving time, remaining time, and indicator showing speed limit and indication if exceeding the limit.\n",
      "Rear seats: Modify front seat mounting to provide more foot space for rear passengers.\n",
      "Offer rear DVDs displays.\n",
      "Temperatures: Interior and exterior temperatures should be displayed on the display screen.\n",
      "Headrests: it would be nice to somehow reduce the size in order to provide better visibility for the rear passengers and reduce the claustrophobic feeling.\n",
      "It's a beautiful, comfortable driving car, somewhat economical and very reliable.\n",
      "The first time every day I took the car out of the garage, there was a shrill, squealing sound coming from the brakes.\n",
      "The last Mercedes our family owned was a diesel 1964 or 1965, and it was a very good, reliable car.\n",
      "I think Mercedes should offer more colors for the interior.\n",
      "If there had been a red leatherÃ¢ÂÂnot fire engine red, but a subtle shade, Red is such a bold, rich color that would look very appropriate on a Mercedes.\n",
      "I would have chosen that color for my car I had red interior on my 1963/4 Mercedes.\n",
      "This GLC300 drives very nicely and the body of the vehicle appears to be mechanically very sound.\n",
      "- The dashboard is making noises in a lot of places (very disappointing for a Mercedes and this is my second GLC300, both have the same problem).\n",
      "- The radio does not have an automatic volume reset after turning it off (probably cost nothing to have this).\n",
      "- The windshield wipers don't operate without visible brakes (very disappointing for a Mercedes and this is my second GLC300, both have the same problem).\n",
      "- The dashboard material look cheaper than the last Corolla rental car I used.\n",
      "- The use of the interior controls (AC, radio, etc.)\n",
      "I am 49. Who uses a CD player anymore?\n",
      "Because if I'm short person and it's not comfortable to use main buttons and touch screen part.\n",
      "It skips letters most of time, so I just use main wheel.\n",
      "Aug 17, 2016I purchased this vehicle because of styling and its performance.\n",
      "toggle AC controller, not easy to use touch pad, reaction speed of main control button/knob).\n",
      "May 24, 2016When I touched inside of door pocket trim, I was disappoint how MB treat details which is reachable.\n",
      "For example, I felt rough and not clean finish on inside of door pocket.\n",
      "Also exposed cables under seat can be better...It's not really representing \"Best or Nothing\" quality finishing.\n",
      "The windshield wipers are defective, fluttering hard while driving, and the driver side wiper will make a hard slide all the way over to the driver's side when turned on during the rain.\n",
      "The sound of the fluttering and the nature of the moving of the wipers is highly distracting and a hazard.\n",
      "After sending Mercedes a letter requesting a buy back due to the visibility issues while wipers are in motion, Mercedes informed me that they will not buy the vehicle back and they don't view faulty wipers as a safety issue.\n",
      "My response is, having faulty wiper system is a an extreme safety issue.\n",
      "The new safety features for turning lanes are standard and are very helpful at times.\n",
      "The rear view camera is very clear compared to a lot of other cars.\n",
      "Fuel economy is moderately good, just depends which dynamic you drive.\n",
      "However I am still getting used the touch pad versus the dial.\n",
      "Overall great vehicle in terms of performance and safety.\n",
      "Jun 25, 2016My only concern about my new vehicle is that it's a little bit difficult to adjust seating from a sedan to an SUV when you are short.\n",
      "I have short legs and have to sit close to the wheel and I am scared that I might get really injured by the airbags if I'm ever in an accident.\n",
      "Too many electronic options (pad, dial, steering column etc.).\n",
      "Needs to have one push button to set the memory seat to 1, 2, or 3, and not have to press and hold until seat moves into position.\n",
      "Seat needs to go to furthest setting when vehicle turns off for ease of entry and exiting car.\n",
      "Mar 18, 2016I would like a few changes that I think can be accomplished in the computer programming of the vehicle, like not having to hold down the memory seat button until all positions have changed.\n",
      "A very good product with excellent finishing quality with the following exceptions: brakes squeal in reverse (three people I know have this problem), high wind noise, and the steering wheel had to be replaced after one month and now the new one is making rubbing noises when being turned.\n",
      "Sep 17, 2016The wind noise is the worst of any vehicle I have driven in 53 years of driving.\n",
      "Sounds like the window is slightly open.\n",
      "Should pick one or at most two styles of entry for electronic display and controls and maximize its potential instead of going with rotary dial/finger pad/voice controls, which just serve to complicate everything and clutter up the front space.\n",
      "Seats are comfortable and craftsmanship is evident.\n",
      "Nov 8, 2016The tires were overinflated and resulted in a tire pressure warning light after the first 200 miles.\n",
      "I'm not a fan of the LED headlights and lack of fog lights.\n",
      "I wish I could lock it into sport mode instead of having to put it in every time I drive it.\n",
      "I feel that the steering and handling are a bit sloppy compared to my previous vehicle (BMW X5).\n",
      "(1) Tech: A few obvious options are missing (like no beeping for backup camera without a certain package); fewer customizations/tech options than expected and rarely a way to set permanently (e.g., disabling voice recommendations on Nav); tech interface is clunky/slow (e.g., accessing a device); mbrace/remote start hardly works.\n",
      "(3) Body: Mirrors/windows are extremely difficult to keep clean.\n",
      "The ONLY thing I would change about this car is the lack of an \"OFF\" button for the climate control system.\n",
      "There should be a button (where current silver A/C buttons are)  that says OFF, that you press once and it turns off the climate control system completely.\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016There is nothing I would change about the 2016 GLC300 EXCEPT adding an \"off\" button to the dash that allows you to shut off the climate control system with one tap.\n",
      "Otherwise it is an extremely comfortable and quiet car that handles great yet has a bit more room for stuff than a sports sedan.\n",
      "Apr 6, 2016I have just returned from a four-day trip that included driving 655 miles on windy two-lane coastal roads.\n",
      "I am a big guy, and if I was to offer any suggestion for the future would have to do with the front drivers seat shoulder room.\n",
      "It also has a good balance between performance and comfort.\n",
      "One issue is that given today's touchscreen interaction with devices, it makes using the Command dial the opposite of what I'd anticipate when I have a horizontal list of options to navigate through.\n",
      "What is disappointing is the cost to have some of the advanced safety features in the vehicle.\n",
      "Luxury is safety.\n",
      "We wanted the safety features, and this vehicle had them at our price point, fortunately.\n",
      "It fulfills all that a normal person would want in a vehicle; versatility, comfort, appearance, economy, and all at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Putting adiesel engine in my GLC 300 would allow fuel mileage in the 40+ range and would create a huge demand.\n",
      "Probably half the time, we find it easier to simply use the phone for navigation.\n",
      "Run flat tires are too loud and ride poorly.\n",
      "The engine is a turbo 4 cylinder with lots of power, but it is loud.\n",
      "The other thing I don't like at all is the backup camera.\n",
      "The GLK I traded in had a perfect backup camera both day and night.\n",
      "The new GLC camera is a huge step back in quality.\n",
      "The vehicle is impossible to drive because the electronics are not intuitive.\n",
      "Quality of audio system is very poor.\n",
      "Navigation system not user friendly/I have use my phone navigation system.\n",
      "Driver-side mirror gets too dark when lights from the vehicle behind hit it; should be up to the driver to activate this feature.\n",
      "At this price, there should be no noise from the vehicle.\n",
      "Headlights are very bright, but fog lights would be nice.\n",
      "Great vehicle--love the ride, power and interior.\n",
      "Window button passenger front seat failed and was quickly fixed\r\n",
      "2.\n",
      "I don't have remote start on my key fob, but have been using the app, with about a 30% success rate.\n",
      "Also find it silly to have to have 1/4 tank of gas for remote start to work.\n",
      "Still dissatisfied that it does not have noise cancellation from wind noise, probably from flat windshield.\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016I was able to obtain the configuration I wanted, i.e., without a sunroof nor navigation having added thousands of dollars in unwanted features.\n",
      "The one item about this vehicle that I do NOT like at all--and am frustrated with--is this: when I am at a light, the engine idles down and cuts the air conditioning down.\n",
      "I do not like having to move the car an inch or two in order for the engine to rev up and the AC to come back to life.\n",
      "When you open the door while the car is still in D (e.g., to check how far you are away from the curb when parking along a sidewalk), the transmission goes to P automatically.\n",
      "No option to buy a spare tire and wheel combo; comes with run-flats only.\n",
      "Steering wheel adjustment motor needed to be replaced.\n",
      "Aug 13, 2016My steering wheel adjustment motor stopped working with less than 2,000 miles on the car!\n",
      "One complaint: I would like to be able to leave air conditioning ON when I exit vehicle and LOCK car so that dogs can be left in a cool car!\n",
      "Sep 12, 2016I wish that the shade in the sunroof could be operated separated from the window itself.\n",
      "Oh, WAIT...I would also like the ability to leave the air conditioning on when I leave the vehicle and LOCK the vehicle.\n",
      "This would be for the safety and comfort of my dog.\n",
      "Great gas mileage, comfort is outstanding, handles great.\n",
      "I do need to take it in to the dealer to check out a possible problem with the recall of the steering column problem.\n",
      "Feb 26, 2016After the test drive, I knew this would be a car that not only would hold up well, but would be a great car to drive, be as comfortable as anything I've yet owned, and hopefully hold its value over time.\n",
      "The cupholders make an annoying sound when to insert or remove a cup.\n",
      "The 2014 Mini Cooper that I own doesn't make any sound when used.\n",
      "Re-engineering the cupholders to eliminate the annoying sound and better hold the cup should be considered.\n",
      "Great car & reliable, safe & beautiful.\n",
      "(2) Move the controls from the middle of the console; too easily changed when touched by accident.\n",
      "(3) COLOR the SOS button RED.\n",
      "Great car with luxurious features.\n",
      "My return to dealer issue is a small dash rattle and when the shop foreman and I test drove the vehicle we could not duplicate the noise at that time, but it still is an issue on occasion which makes it hard to find.\n",
      "I am confident we will get it fixed when conditions are correct to discover the source of the noise.\n",
      "Perhaps my age is a factor, but the electronics & navigation system are difficult to understand, also  trying to use the owners guide and written manual for navigation systems and settings is very unclear and confusing.\n",
      "Length of time between using navigation is very difficult to remember the functions and process.\n",
      "I've had two minor issues, one resolved quickly (resetting the computer) the other (tire pressure readings seem haywire) as of yet unresolved due to it occurring just prior to being out of the country and only just having returned.\n",
      "The driver's side airbag panel was not assembled tightly, so the panel rattled before being repaired.\n",
      "There are a few other minor issues like tire vibration on certain types of roads and a rattle in the driver's side dash.\n",
      "The gas mileage isn't close to what they claim and the battery only lasts 13 miles and doesn't really regenerate while driving.\n",
      "Fix the regeneration of the battery so it recharges as you drive like the Prius.\n",
      "If you are looking for a versatile, intelligent, small SUV with four-wheel drive then Mercedes-Benz is one of the best in the business.\n",
      "Make a hybrid engine GLC 300.\n",
      "I like being up higher, and it's very comfortable to ride in as a passenger.\n",
      "I need to go to the dealer and get some instructions, it really shouldn't be that hard to figure out though...I use my phone instead, which is frustrating.\n",
      "It's not safe to mess with any of it while driving...unless I memorize voice commands I guess.\n",
      "The ride is quiet and comfortable.\n",
      "One of the best options is the lane change warning.\n",
      "It is comforting to have the vehicle warn me when a vehicle is in my blind spot.\n",
      "Reliable, safe In the world that people seem to get larger and larger, please remember that some are still small.\n",
      "Please design driver seat to accommodate those who are 5 feet and under, especially with safety-related to airbag positioning and seat height to allow for good visibility.\n",
      "Very comfortable, plenty of unexpected bells and whistles (like the HOLD brake while at a stoplight), drives beautifully with plenty of power, goes on around curves smoothly, great parking helpers (360 camera, backup camera, self-park).\n",
      "Better quality than similar cars like the BMW, Audi, the Jaguar looks good but too knew and the brand has had a history of longevity issues Yes, the backup camera really should have a warning sound.\n",
      "Need to move the 360 Camera button from the left of the steering wheel to the entertainment console.\n",
      "Need to add button to change radio station on the steering wheel and not have to press seven buttons to get it to work on the steering wheel.\n",
      "My old vehicle had the USB access in the bottom and was a cable that came out and the thumb drive could lie flat on the bottom of middle storage section.\n",
      "I was disappointed that it didn't have some standard features that comes with Infiniti, especially some of the safety features.\n",
      "The automatic engine turn off feature at a stoplight is annoying and should have a way to permanently turn it off.\n",
      "Holds my 3 large dogs comfortably & safely Service department  is awesome; quality of engineering, manufacturing and assembly are great.\n",
      "Car handles and corners great; speed is not an issue; very smooth ride.\n",

      "Display volume of audio system for reference when waiting for music to start.\n",
      "Provide Apple CarPlay support.\n",
      "I am disappointed in the rear backup camera functionality / noise of opening and closing of the camera door, lack of Navigation functionality on display and initial fuel economy.\n",
      "I have to readjust the rear mirror to see the signals.\n",
      "The infotainment and navigation systems are clumsy and over-engineered to the point of not being user friendly.\n",
      "It would be great if when you shut the vehicle off, the drivers seat adjusts to make it easier to get in and out of the car.\n",
      "This should be automatic based on the saved memory setting.\n",
      "The front and rear sensor system sucks.\n",
      "The camera system is good but inadequate.\n",
      "A touchscreen is so much easier to use.\n",
      "Feb 27, 2016Disappointed in the functionality of several features that were considered to be common, primarily rear and forward sensors.\n",
      "I do not carry a purse and would like a designated spot for my keyless key and cellphone that doesn't interfere with the drink holders.\n",
      "Very comfortable even on long road trips and handles well.\n",
      "I contacted mbrace, and was assured it was safe to continue driving the vehicle and arranged an appointment with the dealer for the next day.\n",

      "My biggest disappointments are with regard to usability of electronics; e.g., (1) need quick way to turn on overhead view besides putting car in reverse, such as when pulling into garage or parking spot, (2) info in navigation system is sparse and does not respond to customization, and (3) need complete PAPER user manual with correct referrals; having to go directly to the on-board help system is a pain.\n",
      "Mercedes needs to add good software usability engineers to excellent staff of mechanical engineers.\n",
      "It should have a button to push to turn on parking assist (I have to put transmission in reverse to activate system before pulling forward into my garage).\n",

      "I love features that warn me of blind spots and inattention.\n",

      "My suggestion to Mercedes engineering is to modify their blind spot monitoring system so it functions at all speeds.\n",

      "It's a shame that you don't update the electronics, dashboard, and collision avoidance features on the GLS450.\n",
      "Even cheap cars like the Hyunday Sonata possess these characteristics, whilst the GLS450 dashboard looks like it's frozen in the 90's.\n",
      "It's supposed to be S class status ... Why are there features in the new C class that my GL\"S\" doesn't have as standard equipment... For example ... Driver and passenger seat cushion extenders should be standard and I am very upset that this option is not on my car.\n",
      "Sometimes the controls/technology seem a bit overwhelming but with practice really are easy and convenient.\n",

      "winter driving, performance in snow, reliability, etc.\n",
      "Apr 22, 2016I'm really hoping that technology features are going to become upgradable via software or by other means, even if I have to pay something to do it, because the prevalence of technology systems as part of the driving and ownership experience has become such a dominant part of the vehicle and if they are constantly becoming obsolete it will prematurely date the car and be very frustrating to owners like myself who intend to keep the car for a significant amount of time.\n",
      "While much better than other mid-price competitors, the S class interior is still not quite competitive with top luxury brands.\n",
      "Specific shortcomings: plastic material use inside door storage compartments, at base of seats, on steering wheel column, behind door handles, shroud around ceiling mounted controls.\n",
      "Even with the best possible interior trim package, there is unfortunately extensive use of plastics and cloth where leather should be used, such as inside of door storage compartments, inside glove compartment and center storage compartment, steering column, B pillars, trim piece on top of front seats, and seat bases.\n",
      "The storage space in the door cards is a big failure.\n",
      "If you put your hand in it while driving you can get your hand caught in the wedge of the door card.\n",

      "I was very surprised that I feel safer in Scooter cruising in driving rain on the highway than my Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n",
      "The old models have a strong-sounding horn, which is a safety feature in a small car.\n",

      "Just hit a button on the steering wheel.\n",
      "With the rebates available it costs no more than the Countryman S, gets nearly double the gas mileage, has more power and still drives and handles like a MINI.\n",
      "Warning, the sport seats may be too snug for a big butt.\n",
      "As with all EVs, battery mileage is reduced when using electric heat.\n",

      "It would be nice if the heads up display had the turn signal, so that you don't leave it on when you change lanes.\n",
      "Its fun, but can't understand why you wouldn't include a BLIS system or have total charging connectivity with Apple phones.\n",

      "Bring back button that folded mirrors in.\n",
      "Not crazy about new steering wheel material.\n",

      "The interior design is inconvenient for me as a short driver: the cup holders are too far away and the cup gets tangled with the phone charger.\n",
      "Center console is useless as I have to have the seat very far forward to reach the pedals and for same reason cannot lower the side visor to block the sun.\n",

      "This MINI Cooper S gets much better mileage, has much more power, and is twice as quiet as my last one.\n",
      "Apr 29, 2016The AC vent aims straight at the back of the steering wheel - not good for a car used in the desert.\n",

      "Lastly don't purchase this vehicle because Mini does not make any accessories to customize the 2016 two door cooper.\n",
      "The idea of purchasing a Mini Cooper is such that you can customize the vehicle however the 2016 two door models have little to no accessories and that's disappointing.\n",
      "The seats were comfortable and as always, it drives well.\n",
      "For instance, the steering wheel not adjusting by itself when you enter or leave the car, push button seat adjust, floor mats gives a \"cheap\" impression, etc.\n",

      "My only complaint about my 2016 MINI is the quality of the leather on the sport seats is not up to par for a $30K+ car.\n",
      "I traded in a 2013 Honda Accord with leather seats, and the quality of the leather on those seats was far superior to the MINI leather.\n",
      "After only about 2 weeks, the side of the drivers seat near the door received a couple of small cuts, and I'm still not sure how that happened since I only drive the car and am dressed for business most of the time (I'm not a contractor with a tool belt, etc.).\n",
      "When I took it to the dealer I was told that leather damage wasn't covered and a new seat back would cost about $1,000.\n",
      "It seems the choice of leather was poor and if I could change anything about my purchase I would not have purchased leather seats.\n",

      "I thought at first that I had a rattle in my car but it turned out to be the chip of my garage door opener hitting on some metal bit of the car.\n",
      "I love my car...except for the price, but quality does have it's price.\n",

      "My biggest glaring problem with an otherwise perfect car, is the inability to use my iPhone hands free when it's connected to Bluetooth.\n",
      "The idea that I have to chose between hands free calling or hands free phone operation is critical... please fix this for future cars, it's unacceptable in 2016 at its price point.\n",
      "Lastly, why can't all the door unlock when you get out of the car?\n",
      "For instance, if I have groceries in the back seat and get out of the car and go to open the back door I have to hit the unlock button or my keys.\n",
      "Thank goodness the ride is still great and the exterior looks super cool.\n",
      "I have been disappointed with the human factors used in the center control display.\n",

      "Why can't the clock display use this area?\n",
      "A second example: For running errands around town I use the GREEN mode of driving.\n",
      "Feb 3, 2016While I like the MINI a lot, I am a little disappointed with the electronics in terms of ease of use and also visibility while driving.\n",
      "Either get AWD or the best road handling tires possible.\n",

      "Handle locking takes multiple clicksÃ¢ÂÂshould be ONE.\n",
      "When using key fob to lock doors, you can't really hear the locks go down.\n",
      "Need some more noise to hear it actually lock.\n",
      "Make two-door Cooper S with AWD AND in white exterior with black interiorÃ¢ÂÂnot that I'm picky.\n",
      "Sep 16, 2016Why does opening the sunroof take six clicks of the button?\n",
      "Why does locking the door take on average six clicks on the handle?\n",

      "GET THE CHROME OFF THE STEERING WHEEL AND DASHBOARD; IT SHOULD BE FLAT BLACK TO NOT REFLECT THE SUN!\n",
      "I hoped the lights on the new car would be an improvement but they are actually worseÃ¢ÂÂI can't shake the feeling that I'm overdriving them at 70 mph on the interstate.\n",
      "Instead, as I did with the first Mini, I am installing a set of aftermarket driving lights to compensateÃ¢ÂÂcheaper than the factory LED headlights and actually add a bit of a more sporty look.\n",
      "When I decided on leasing a brand new premium trim fully loaded Mini Cooper S without the opportunity to see or test drive one because there was none available, I was expecting to get all features that I paid for plus those that are now being offered standard in fewer premium vehicles such as Honda and Toyota.\n",
      "It is a real inconvenience not to have power seats in a fully loaded model and the fact that Mini got rid of the hidden drawer is ludicrous and counter productive.\n",
      "Also, the car does not offer blind side sensors and all the arm rest offers is a charging station that does not work with standard Apple phone cases.\n",
      "There has been asignificant change in how this car handles, powers, steers & accelerate - from the prior year's model.\n",
      "The auto shut-off feature is a serious gas guzzler.\n",
      "Wish they would have kept the steering, acceleration, handling & window controls the same.\n",
      "The driver has to disable the auto shutoff feature and select 'Sport Mode', in order to attempt to get similar performance as prior models/platforms.\n",
      "I miss the 'bulldog' steering & handling.\n",
      "Exterior design is nicely done, some features I feel like they're overpriced, like satellite radio.\n",
      "My only complaint so far is the not so convenient location of the interior door locks, I have long legs and I'm constantly hitting it with my knee, I wish they were placed further away in the door toward the steering wheel.\n",
      "It's a fun, small vehicle with lots of personality fun to drive and has great gas mileage.\n",
      "Drove my MINI off the lot and within one minute of driving away a tire sensor was already going off, not the best start.\n",
      "Jul 28, 2016One small minor negative thing when I first took home my new MINI: the low tire pressure light went off only seconds after leaving the curb.\n",
      "I drove it home and easily put air in the tire, but if I am buying a brand new car with 24 miles on it, and that I am driving off the lot for the first time warning lights shouldn't already be going off.\n",
      "I love my MINI Cooper 4 door S. My little kids and I take it everywhere.\n",
      "Since it is low to the ground and the doors are smaller than on larger cars, they can open and close the doors by themselves.\n",
      "The seats great really hot in the sun=butt sweat.\n",
      "The rearview mirror isn't long enough to see full rear window because it is tapered.\n",
      "Better phone integration in particular navigation should be part of the media upgrade package.\n",
      "Meaning with the Media Upgrade package, I should be able to use my phone to connect to navigation app and make it work with my car to provide voice turn by turn navigation.\n",
      "The most important one is ability to use for turn-by-turn navigation.\n",
      "I have the Carbon limited addition and feel it should have the rear backup camera with the premium Nav system.\n",
      "It should have come with flat load floor and a rear boot power outlet.\n",
      "It has the sport seats and no lumbar support.\n",
      "Feb 1, 2016Limited production did not have flat load floor in boot, so no power outlet as was a part of unavailable package.\n",
      "The rear fog lights are on the car and are not wired in.\n",
      "However, it creates a very bad \"dark zone\" between the lights when I use my brights.\n",
      "I loved the classic beauty of my 2002 Mini's dash layout - the big simple displays, etc.\n",
      "The high-tech displays are a big annoyance to me - I really just want to know how fast I'm going, how far I've gone, how much gas I have and if there's anything that I should be checking on, etc.\n",
      "Great gas mileage, performs well in snow and slippery conditions, can customize a lot of the vehicle to be what you want, is really fun to drive, handles well.\n",
      "Dec 26, 2016Wish that the HVAC control module in Auto mode would take in the exterior temp data and if below 40 degress outside it would automically change airflow to be both at your feet and at the dash vents, shouldn't have to change this myself.\n",
      "And if it's warm out, it already knows, when in auto mode, to have the cold air come out of the dash vents.\n",
      "We walk everyday no matter what the weather is and a rugged rear cargo area would be fantastic.\n",
      "I love my MINI but some of the plastic hardware feels cheap (center armrest, paneling in and outside of the vehicle, seats.\n",

      "Rear moonroof should open.\n",
      "Should have electric seats.\n",
      "The Mini Cooper S  is a fun, safe, and reasonably priced vehicle.\n",
      "Oct 31, 2016So far my only critique is that for me, being 6'1\" tall, the windshield area is narrow, and I have a hard time seeing traffic lights at a stop.\n",
      "I have tried adjusting the seat but it won't give me the view I want for the traffic light.\n",
      "Other than that.\n",
      "That's a big one for me.\n",
      "(Everything includes the parking brake, my elbow when shifting, and the infotainment controller).\n",
      "Oct 31, 2016Thank you for keeping at least some amount of steering feel in this car.\n",
      "Consider a flat-bottom steering wheel for bonus points.\n",
      "I need to back up about 100 feet along a lane that is narrow and not straight, there are no lights in this area, and the backup lights barely do the job of providing visibility.\n",
      "It would be nice to have a rear-mount bicycle rack for this model (Mini Cooper 4-door Hardtop).\n",
      "So far every new one has brought improvements with ONE exception: I actually prefer the power window toggles back on the center console where they were instead of moving them to the doors.\n",
      "There are lots of occasions when it's easier to keep my left hand on the wheel and operate the windows with my right hand.\n",
      "Because I'm tall, it is difficult to see the light thru the windshield.\n",
      "The top edge of the windshield is typically too low and cuts off my visibility of the light overhead.\n",
      "It comes with no CD player, only a radio.\n",
      "Start featuring automatic starters.\n",
      "Stop charging so much for every single little feature.\n",
      "I do NOT use my phone for music in the car because it is not safeÃ¢ÂÂwould require my taking my eyes off the road too much,  and I am in places where radio is spotty.\n",
      "The dashboard has computer modes.\n",
      "What's with that colored jukebox in the middle of the dashboard?\n",
      "And why does it change colors while you drive?\n",
      "I'm used to the basic Fifties/Sixties style of Veglia/S-W/Jones style of basic dials with pointers.\n",
      "Forget about adult humans actually using the backseat (but that's not super important to me).\n",
      "Wish the navigation had more accurate real-time traffic data or if it would sink with app (Waze), but otherwise the functionality & ease of use is pretty good, somewhat difficult to input addresses tho, but I still have yet to figure out voice commands.\n",
      "Also get the wheel and tire protection.\n",
      "Run flats make for a very stiff ride, and it would be great if they could be replaced with regular tires.\n",

      "Not only for convenience but for safety.\n",
      "I am really not a fan of the controls for the radio, telephone, media, and navigation.\n",
      "Controls on the steering wheel would be better and your eyes wouldn't have to leave the road to find the right button for the mode you want.\n",
      "It's pretty lame that the Bluetooth only works with phone and not music.\n",
      "Bluetooth connectivity should work with my music, not just phone.\n",
      "Also would like to have a glove compartment that has a lock on it in case you want to leave windows open.\n",
      "I won't be spending money on new tires, however.\n",
      "Better acceleration, better safety, better room.\n",
      "There is just too much going on with all the lights around the center console which really do nothing for meÃ¢ÂÂthe media/function interface isn't intuitive and iPhone control could be better.\n",
      "I wish the front seats had lumbar support and profile settings.\n",
      "I don't like the extender in the seat bottom.\n",
      "The only \"problem\" we had was understanding the engine-stop feature when the vehicle is stopped.\n",
      "The activation toggle switch is counterintuitive, as the switch light is on when the feature is off, and off when the feature is on.\n",
      "That was my favorite feature to show everyone and the options to change colors was a neat touch.\n",
      "The run flat tires detract from the drive ability of the car and increase the road noise considerably.\n",
      "Once they are exchanged for normal tires, the driving experience and road noise should both improve.\n",
      "The steering wheel hand controls should be reversed for manual shift cars in the USA.\n",
      "Give ME the OPTION to dispense with that stupid center console and instead having one little CD slot to play MY choice of music.\n",
      "The door pockets are a joke for holding anything.\n",
      "What happened to all the cool interior storage options and why did you put in that ridiculous drivers arm rest?\n",
      "MINI could've taken the JCW up another level by simply including upgraded floor mats (stock carpet savers were plain black, not even the MINI logo) and adding MINI logo courtesy or puddle lights to both doors.\n",
      "Like to stay connected with vehicle and like the 6-speed transmission.\n",
      "I am also critical of the large size if it relative to my 2004 MINI and wish that it offered analog fuel and temperature gauges and an oil dipstick.\n",
      "I am happy with my new Mini, but it is using way more gas than I expected.\n",
      "I have been using the green option and I hope that will save on gas.\n",
      "The only suggestions I have is to make the car a little \"taller\" and to make the seats slide all the way forward on the two-door models.\n",
      "This would help with access to the rear seat.\n",
      "My wheels bent from hitting a small pothole.\n",

      "There really is nothing I can comment on except a better manual on how to use the dashboard.\n",
      "Apr 21, 2016Somewhat jerky off the starting and stopping line, the auto off-on feature doesn't help this problem.\n",

      "With a 3-cylinder engine, it has surprising power.\n",
      "It does have a minor squeak sometimes near the steering column.\n",
      "Aug 8, 2016Leatherette seats can get a little hot in the summer, and I would not get them again.\n",

      "Keyless manual lock takes too long (must press button on outside handle three times).\n",
      "I wish the seats would've been electronic rather than with handles.\n",

      "I'm impressed on how the manufacturer continues to refine the design, features, and overall driving experience.\n",
      "I don't like the quality of the black plastic material on the door.\n",
      "Could use more cupholders in the rear seat, only has one, recommend at least two.\n",

      "I do not like the tires at all, and I miss a CD player.\n",

      "My Mitsubishi is fun to drive, reliable and comfortable.\n",
      "My wife and I really enjoy our Mitsubishi, it has been comfortable on long, 600 mile =/-, drives, it is reliable, gets good gas mileage, SUV type, and it is quiet inside.\n",
      "I do not think the price is worth it, especially because the technology is outdated.\n",

      "The Nissan 370Z Nismo Tech is a highly reliable performance sports car that is easy, comfortable, and fun to drive.\n",
      "It handles well including cornering, passing, climbing/acceleration, and braking.\n",
      "Every time I get behind the wheel, I thank the engineers for designing and creating this performance sports car.\n",
      "I've had strangers ask me in parking lots, and at gas stations, if it's fast, if it's fun to drive, and they've also said, \"that's a good looking car.\"\n",
      "Aug 27, 2016Honestly, the engineers at Nissan really did a great job with the 370Z Nismo tech.\n",
      "A few things I would like to see added are: a telescopic steering wheel, a sliding moonroof or sunroof, power seats, a compartment for sunglasses (for storing at night of course).\n",
      "I would have to just say for the amount of money I paid for the car, the features on the inside are not good at all.\n",
      "No Bluetooth for music, no backup camera and the receiver is basic, my grandma has a Nissan Sentra, and it has the same receiver in it, and it's eight years old.\n",
      "But the Bose speakers are super nice, and I also like the options on the steering wheel.\n",
      "Dec 9, 2016The inside needs to have more standard options, like backup camera and modern receiver, also a side vehicle detector.\n",
      "Oct 22, 2016Try to include more standard equipment (i.e., rearview camera, upgraded radio display unit).\n",
      "The 370Z is a quality sports car that is sporty, handles well, has a much improved engine, and is an all-round great car for the price.\n",
      "Aug 15, 2016Only area of concern are:\r\n",
      "1) the handling (roll) quality on the package I purchased (Sport), it seems likely the manufacturer may reserve the firmest suspensions for higher packages (track, NISMO), whereas in pervious models (350Z, Enthusiast package) the handling was superior/firmer.\n",
      "I would love if the seat had electric adjustment instead of manual.\n",
      "The only drawback about the car is the seating adjustments were manual not electrical to raise the seat and the back.\n",
      "The seat sinks in the middle because it is a sport car, but I wish that there was a middle adjustment to make it rise up.\n",
      "It is me!!.\n",
      "I do wish that the seats had power to handle the movement instead of manual.\n",
      "Exceptional handling and power.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016The great overall performance of this car deserves a much better OEM tire such as the Michelin Pilot Super Sport or A/S 3 +.\n",
      "I like the rearview mirror and window.\n",
      "This vehicle has too much road and wind noise and has large blind spots.\n",
      "Be sure you know how to properly position and use side mirrors.\n",
      "I got the Touring package, which is about as close to luxury features for the 370z.\n",
      "I would've been willing to pay a bit more for a bit more full leather seats and a few other luxury stylings.\n",
      "Good performance, but would like more horsepower.\n",
      "Performance and styling are excellent.\n",
      "Blind spots to the rear are prominent.\n",
      "Bad blind spots,  interior isn't high quality, loud road noise.\n",
      "It's fun to drive and is super sweet in the style and appearance.\n",
      "Get acquainted with the driver-assist in cruise control, this care is getting excellent gas mileage and I've only had it 2 1/2 months.\n",
      "I rolls back and forth in the trunk, makes noises and takes up room that I need when packing for a trip.\n",
      "The vehicle looks great, modern, the tinted windows are a bonus, and the gas tank gets me over 500 miles with a fill.\n",
      "And it drives very smooth I feel safe in it.\n",
      "1) it was hard to tell if I had the remote starter on the keyfob, and if I had the collision on the side in the rearview window (I do not).\n",
      "3) The vehicle drives well on the highway feels solid\r\n",
      "4) as a first timer with the display it was easy to maneuver ie.\n",
      "I like the GPS it is displayed on a large screen, the car stops and doesn't let you rear-end another car.\n",
      "I would like a swivel seat to better get out of the driver's side of the car.\n",
      "Also, the seat belt is very uncomfortable.\n",
      "it is not Nissan that use to be 10 years ago, take a road test to see how you like it remove driver assistance and install self dimming rear view mirror.\n",
      "The location of and lack of enough child seat tethers.\n",
      "This car only allows for three total tethers (two in the middle row and one in the third row, meaning you can only have three car seats in an eight-passenger vehicle!)\n",
      "*The middle row needs a tether in the middle seat!\n",
      "The fact that you can't do a forward-facing car seat in the middle seat is very frustrating.\n",
      "This means that you can only use the two window seats for forward-facing car seats and therefore cannot access the third row when you have two forward-facing car seats installed in the middle row.\n",
      "I strongly feel the two seater bench and the one seater bench should be flipped as the safest place in the car is the middle seat and behind the passenger.\n",
      "The way the bench is configured, you have to install one forward- and one rear-facing car seat on the bench behind the driver's seat so that you can access the third row.\n",
      "In my opinion this is sacrificing on safety and I get seriously mad every time I put my kids in the seat behind me, the driver.\n",
      "I had to pull out an old cigarette lighter charger I used on my car from 2005.\n",
      "It's 2016 now, lose at least one of the cigarette lighters for charging.\n",
      "I just wished the headlights where better, specially low beam (they are to low), and the car needs cornering lights.\n",
      "I just wished the headlights where better, specially low beam (the light projection is to low, even when adjusted too its maximum height), and the car needs cornering lights.\n",
      "The back seat air flow delivery doesn't seem ideal.\n",
      "The back up camera resolution is lacking.\n",
      "I love the automatic start of the DVD when I turn on my vehicle, but would like a way to keep it on, say while I'm pumping gas with my engine off.\n",
      "The only two things that really worry me about the purchase of this vehicle are the wind noise and the fact that the doors sound like tin cans when closing.\n",
      "I am having difficulties getting used to the nighttime driving and headlight adjustment.\n",
      "Needs outside temperature and compass moved to rearview mirror.\n",
      "Dec 9, 2016Compass is poorly displayed and so is outside temperature readout.\n",
      "Doors should unlock when placed in park.\n",
      "Quality control could have been better, has some issues with lighting.\n",
      "Wish they would have done more with the dash display.\n",
      "The third row seats need to fold flat.\n",
      "Great ride and comfortable ride.\n",
      "Could use more cargo room.\n",
      "But, after realizing what it would cost to change the exterior look of the truck (wheels/tires/chrome pieces), I decided to trade the Pro-4x in on a used 2015 Nissan Frontier SL Crew Cab/long wheelbase.\n",
      "By doing that, I ended up with a top-of-the-line Frontier, I have a full-size backseat now, and I have like 12 extra options that I still wouldn't have if I had kept the Pro-4x, and I spent the same amount of money that I would have spent on my Pro-4x (with all the exterior changes).\n",
      "There are some quality issues/problems that I am noticing on my used 2015 Nissan Frontier SL Crew Cab/long wheelbase, and I am going to try and correct those issues myself.\n",
      "The satellite radio/navigation antenna on the roof of the cab is a little crooked; I'm gonna try and straighten it out.\n",
      "So, now I am making several exterior changes to my truck, to make it look and ride like an SV trim level (change the front grille, the back bumper, the suspension/shocks, the wheels, the tires, and have those Pro-4x/tire tread stickers removed from the back corners of the box).\n",
      "When complete, my truck will \"look\" like an SV trim level from the exterior, but it will have the mileage computer and navigation system, options only available in the Pro-4x trim level of the King-cab size, so you could then call it an SV+, the + standing for those two options just mentioned.\n",
      "I'm also adding sound-proofing to the interior of the cabin, caused it seemed noisy.\n",
      "Feb 14, 2016Well, I purchased the most \"loaded up with options/features\" Nissan Frontier King Cab that I could (the Pro-4x model), but I did not want or need any of the off-road features/styling that that model came with, so I am making lots of exterior changes to the truck, to make it look more like an SV or SL trim level Frontier (changed the wheels to the SV wheels, changed the tires to black side-wall tires like an SL, will have the Pro-4x stickers on the back of the bed taken off, and may change the front grille and rear bumper to be shiny chrome, like on an SV).\n",
      "Features that my 19-year-old car had, but now my new truck doesn't have include LIGHTED visor vanity mirrors, heated side mirrors, rear window defroster, and power seats.\n",
      "Change bed light control to auto/off/on, and make the dipstick more accessible.\n",
      "Only negative since last survey is that that interior door panels seem to nick a bit too easy.\n",
      "Previously reported: Turning radius could be better, and auto cargo lights should have a bypass switch, such as on/off/auto.\n",
      "Otherwise, performance, ride and capability are excellent.\n",
      "Wish bed light had auto/on/off switch instead of auto with any door opening.\n",
      "Wife likes (a) 8 cup holders, (b) upper and lower glovebox, (c) wide door pockets, and (d) comfortable ride, although it does sidestep around curves over bumps, due to higher profile tires (which we like for going over rocks).\n",
      "In addition to torque/acceleration, I like under rear seat storage for tools, tow strap, jumper cables, tie downs, etc and room behind back seat for jacket, thin backpack, as well as factory jack and tire tools.\n",
      "I hated the newly redesigned 2016 Toyota Tacoma (both in style and the low seating positionÃ¢ÂÂand that hideous hood scoop that many of the Toyotas have), and the price of the Nissan Frontier SV 4x4 6-speed manual truck could not be beat.\n",
      "If you want a reasonable priced manual transmission truck with go anywhere 4x4, this truck is great.\n",
      "However, I really wanted to purchase a compact pickup truck that offered a 6-speed manual transmission and I've had a previous Nissan Frontier for 100,000 miles and the reliability was phenomenal.\n",
      "I also didn't like the new polarizing, redesigned Toyota Tacoma (which was the only other 4-door compact pickup truck with a 6-speed manual), and for the money, the Nissan Frontier SV 4WD was quite a value.\n",
      "It actually is fun to drive too and I think the styling, while old, is still better looking than the Tacoma.\n",
      "The engine sounds awesome too.\n",
      "If I were to look for a regular 4-door cab compact pickup truck with an automatic transmission, and I had another $10k to buy a loaded truck with leather seats, then I probably would have chosen the Chevrolet Colorado.\n",
      "Jun 4, 2016I really bought the Nissan Frontier because of the fact that Nissan still offers a 6-speed manual transmission, and it is priced well below a comparable Toyota Tacoma 4WD truck, and in my opinion, does not look ugly like the \"new\" Toyota Tacoma.\n",
      "I still like the Nissan styling, however if the Nissan was priced higher, I would then have not bought it.\n",
      "Things found on basic models of other brands, such as auto lights, reverse camera, outside temperature gage, compass, etc., seem like low budget items that should be standard on all modern vehicles (especially when someone spends $30,000 on the latest model).\n",
      "Somethings I would change with the interior design would be the seating, windows, and the lack of lighting.\n",
      "Also, it would be a welcome feature if the rear window had an electric open and close option (like the Titan).\n",
      "The seating is, for the most part, comfortable.\n",
      "Maybe adding lumbar support for the passenger seating would help this issue.\n",
      "As for the driver seat, there should be a little more room to move back.\n",
      "I am 6' tall, and have to keep the seat all the way back in order to sit comfortably.\n",
      "One feature I did like about the previous model of the Desert Runner, was the folding front passenger seat.\n",
      "Feb 2, 2016I was rather disappointed when I found out that the 2016 Frontier model I purchased didn't come with a backup cam, navigation, auto lights, or even an exterior temperature gage.\n",
      "My new Nissan Frontier rides like a luxury vehicle.\n",
      "And since ride is more important to me than any other feature in a vehicle, I purchased the Frontier over the Tacoma.\n",
      "The ride is exceptional for a truck, which was also a selling feature.\n",
      "However, I still bought it because of the comfort and size that was more important to me than any other features.\n",
      "The navigation and voice recognition are also horrible, as is iPhone compatibility and the \"safety\" feature of disabling features on the touchscreen while moving is far more annoying and unsafe than if they just left it alone.\n",
      "It also make no sense this is not disabled with a passenger present, since the car already has a passenger sensor for the airbag.\n",
      "If Tacomas had power seats and leather, I would have bought a Tacoma instead.\n",
      "Front passenger seat is smaller - not as long - as the 2010 model.\n",
      "I don't use the fold-up rear seats in the king cab, but really appreciate having this space available behind the front seats for storage - do not do away with the king cab option!\n",
      "Jul 6, 2016The passenger front seat in the 2016 is shorter than the seat in the 2007 model.\n",
      "Increase the storage capacity or file handling capability of the sound system - my MP3 player holds 10,000 songs, why can't my truck handle a flash drive that holds at least that amount?\n",
      "Backup sensors in the bumper are a stupid location because bumpers often get dinged, muddy, and the sensors will need expensive replacement.\n",
      "I don't need all the extra speakers, Bluetooth, XM, heated seats, too much useless stuff for me, what is with the brakes?\n",
      "Somebody needs to check out the competition, my '72 beetle has better brakes, turning radius, design the Frontier from the ground up, stop using the big frame from the Titan, my Suburban has a better turning radius, if I really want to haul something, I need to attach my trailer, pallets on-off easily, big load just drop right on, has anyone looked at European and Asian trucks with the sides that fold down, now that is a useful truck, a real work truck, which is what I wanted, but not available in the USA, so I had to settle for a load from the back American truck, which  I consider almost not much of a useful working vehicle.\n",
      "The seat back lumbar support is too firm.\n",
      "The LCD numerical displays (mileage, cabin temperatures) are difficult to read due to red background and black numbers - I am red-green colorblind.\n",
      "The tie down handles in the back are a nice feature for securing my cargo.\n",
      "The material for the seats has a honeycomb pattern, that is hard to clean-gets stuff stuck in it, and it won't vacuum out easily.\n",
      "Feb 8, 2016There was not enough attention to detail: the trim pieces do not fit together well, the back door dose not shut well, unless it is slammed, and the cloth seats have pockets that collect saw dust/dirt.\n",
      "Six cylinder 4.0 engine is not economical, burns same amount of fuel or less than a GM eight cylinder Vortex 5.3.\n",
      "Visibility is good and safety features are abundant.\n",
      "It's poor quality and does not add anything to the vehicle's performance.\n",
      "It's comfortable, easy and fun to drive, and meets my needs.\n",
      "I hate the headrests/restraints.\n",
      "The Frontier NEEDS blindspots cameras on the sideview mirrors.\n",
      "I don't understand why the cameras are not standard.\n",
      "I love the way it drives--so powerful and yet easy to handle.\n",
      "I would have liked the interior to be better appointed, not so basic, and I would have liked more choice about how the interior was going to be but, what a pleasure to drive and to own!\n",
      "Since is is a truck and a V-6, I didn't expect the mileage of a smaller engine or car.\n",
      "I am a large person with a minor hip problem, so the higher truck seat makes it easier to exit the truck..\n",
      "I am not so stupid as to believe what is printed on the window sticker next to the price.\n",
      "I wanted a basic truck with power windows and locks, air conditioning, good sound system, with a hitch for hauling a trailer, and one I could carry most construction materials in the back.\n",
      "Jun 6, 2016The screen for the info center/radio information is hard to see due to glare from the sun.\n",
      "The interior is the same as the old Frontier from 10 years ago excluding the radio.\n",
      "Also I don't like how the desert runner doesn't have a reverse camera, and the dash screen isn't able to hook up to a stock reverse camera, I have to get aftermarket.\n",
      "The Frontier still has the same interior as 10 years ago except the screen and Bluetooth.\n",
      "The power and acceleration I have to say is better than the Tacoma I test drove.\n",
      "A lumbar support in the seats would be nice.\n",
      "I like the way it looks inside and out, I like the way it drives, I like the fuel economy, I like the cargo capacity, it's nice and quiet inside, the features are nice-(!cruise control!, traction control, kick-butt A/C), the ride is very comfortable, the ride position is perfect, even for me (6 ft 4 in).\n",
      "The only thing that is a slight problem is the material used to make the center console/door panels.\n",
      "3- Basic front caption chair seat is uncomfortable with bad placement of the cupholders\r\n",
      "4- Tool box is too deep for a short bed truck.\n",
      "6- Issue finding a long bed and 4 door.\n",
      "I've never had the back tires slip in wet conditions.\n",
      "The Utili-Track feature is very flexible and useful!\n",
      "Only minor annoyance is a rattle above the interior light/speaker/glasses holder panel that I am taking in for correction.\n",
      "Nice stereo system and blue tooth technology but no satellite radio options, keyed ignition, old fashioned trip meter rather than a computer, fog lights but no automatic headlamps, heated cloth seats but not even the driver seat is powered.\n",
      "No garage door opener.\n",
      "Auto lights were not part of the high-end vehicle I purchased...really??\n",
      "Also the vents in the dash don't have a way to shut them, so when I'm driving my wife around she likes it too hot for me, and even though my temp setting is much lower than hers, I get heat from my vents.\n",
      "Was not happy with initial quality of my purchase, some things have needed work, the TPMS, for one, and the window tinting was poorly done.\n",
      "Jul 26, 2016Not at all happy with the quality of the window tinting, it was poorly applied, and still hasn't been fixed.\n",
      "I was under the impression that I would be able to remotely start the truck, and unlock my doors.\n",
      "Rear head rests block too much of the rear view through the cab.\n",
      "Door handle to pull the door close is too far out when door is open.\n",
      "Vents on dash do not have enough range of motion.\n",
      "The rear seat headrests block 2/3 of the visibility out of the back window.\n",
      "I would also like to see Nissan develop \"in-channel\" window vent visors for the crew cab that cover the entire rear door window and not just the operable section.\n",
      "Aug 13, 2016While the in-dash display size is adequate for SiriusXM readout, it is definitely too small for navigation use.\n",
      "It's very difficult to read maps or other navigation information at a glance while driving.\n",
      "Screen should be at least 7\" diagonally to be useful for navigation.\n",
      "My windows, when lowered halfway, makes a creaking or squeaking sound while driving.\n",
      "The sound happens when the window is in a fixed position.\n",
      "The gas mileage needs improving and the steering/turning radius could be better.\n",
      "Acceleration/pedal feel is not smooth and the transmission needs the passing gear to go up moderate inclines.\n",
      "I feel the quality of the interior materials is subpar (hard looking plastic and surfaces) and some switch locations are just awkward (i.e., sideview mirror adjustment (on dash, really?)\n",
      "and window switches (too far back on door)).\n",
      "Rear headrests block a lot of rear vision.\n",
      "It's a simple, inexpensive workhorse I can comfortably haul my family around in as well as our stuff.\n",
      "Just enough modern creature comforts to keep me happy, but I would pay for upgrades if available (keyless entry/push button start, intelligent driver aids, etc) I love everything about it.\n",
      "3) The steering wheel controls for radio and cruise control stick out too far which can be annoying.\n",
      "Make the steering wheel telescopic and not just tilt...and/or make the accelerator pedal adjustable for shorter drivers.\n",
      "Aug 13, 2016My main complaint with the vehicle is the placement of the accelerator peddle...too far forward for shorter drivers...and the steering wheel.\n",
      "It adjusts up and down but needs to telescope front and back to better accommodate different drivers for comfort and safety.\n",
      "HOWEVER the slant of the backup camera screen tilts FORWARD toward the windshield.\n",
      "The camera I use almost daily for backing up to my two trailers...that is when I can actually see whats on the screen.\n",
      "The doors do not seal as good as your 2012.\n",
      "Nissan need to put in a cargo storage area that is built into the bed area, also more interior lighting, better headlights, and offer a higher fuel mileage on small trucks ( a smaller, sporty Frontier).\n",
      "The only thing I DON'T like about the new Frontier is that the manual transmission version is not available with roof racks but the automatic is (or that's what I've been told) that's a really odd manufacturing decision if that's the case.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016My trade-in vehicle had a bench seat, after long periods of driving my wife and I would have sore backs and sore legs.\n",
      "I imagine this has something to do with the bucket seat and the lumbar support.\n",
      "The two areas that I am not pleased with are that there is only one door lock and secondly, I feel the\r\n",
      "engine is underpowered.\n",
      "Feb 18, 2016Passenger door needs a lock for certain.\n",
      "What happens if the driver door is broken?\n",
      "The engine should be direct injection and get better fuel mileage.\n",
      "The interior should make better use of the console, get rid of the big shifter, put it on the steering column and put the parking brake on the floor to make more room for console storage.\n",
      "Pluses: (1) Love the interior (beige color), and quality/comfort of the seats.\n",
      "The left dash speaker cover is not put in well.\n",
      "I do like the look and feel of driving, and the truck looks great, although the black around windows and door handles leak black down the side when it rains.\n",
      "Please make sure the headlights' light output is adequate on the new model when it's launched.\n",
      "ENTRY DOOR DIMENSIONS AREN'T TALL ENOUGH (I'm only 6'0\").\n",
      "SHOULD OFFER \"WRAP-AROUND\" SAFETY PROTECTION/VIEWS AS \"STD\" EQUIP EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD BE INCLUDE \"CONSUMER SAFETY\"  PROTECTIONS FROM THE BASE MODEL UPWARDS.\n",
      "Good sound reliable vehicle.\n",
      "Needs wider gear ratios (lower 1st gear, higher 6th gear)\r\n",
      "Heated mirrors should be available on any trim level.\n",
      "Dec 5, 2016Manual trans could have wider gear ratios, miss heated mirrors.\n",
      "But compared to other brands, they are outdated as far as interior and exterior looks.\n",
      "My 2000 Frontier had a better system that had rear seat speakers that had more power.\n",
      "The speakers vibrate with base from Sirius and regular radio is terrible, dropping door speakers and rear speakers, only coming from Dashboard...very weak!\n",
      "The driver side armrest took awhile to get used to.\n",
      "When selecting the heater location to blow on your feet, it seems that the heating isn't blowing on my feet, the heat blows up between my legs into my face, which I hate.\n",
      "The seats need more adjustments steering wheel needs more adjustments such as telescopic in and out more room in front seats little hard to get in like to have long wheelbase option and manual transmission as well and a selection of different motors.\n",
      "Overall, very satisfied, but driver's door does not shut smoothly and needs more force than usual; engine s/u idle seems way too fast; environmental controls should go digital; and really need a compass and thermometer.\n",
      "About the only things I would like to change about this truck: The interior seating needs to be a little bigger, (maybe I should have looked at a Titan).\n",
      "The radio, I can hardly hear the rear speakers.\n",
      "Vehicle has strong power train, good performance.\n",
      "Apr 4, 2016My vehicle was purchased as a multi task vehicle...(tow a boat or trailer, seat four and have a truck bed for cargo).\n",
      "I own another vehicle with leather seats and all the extras, it is also a hard top convertable.\n",
      "Doesn't have automatic headlights or day-time driving lights, which should be mandatory in all vehicles.\n",

      "The V6 does not have much power and yet gets poor mileage.\n",

      "The brakes could be better, now the thing that is really annoying is how the car perfoms at low speeds it feels like hesitating when you gently accelerate or use the brakes, I am not sure if this is a programming issue or the new CVT design has a problem?\n",
      "I  wish the smart or adaptive cruise had an option to be used like just a regular cruise control because I like to use the cruise in the city too where it's possible and the smart cruise is not that convenient because it reacts to lots of things.\n",

      "I love the interior, Nissan did an awesome job on the leather, accents,nav, driver seat etc.\n",
      "The  feature that I tested the most during my 700miles trip was the new cruise control, the sensors worked well along with the braking and accelaration system.\n",

      "The only way to get the memory seats was to pay several thousands of dollars more for the Platinum level.\n",
      "One of the most important things I considered in a vehicle was the lumbar support in the seats, so I hope this continues to be a mainstay in the product.\n",

      "Jun 4, 2016The first time I ever sat in a leather seat, it in PA & the outside temperature was about 20 degrees.\n",
      "No leather seats for me, but a few years later looking at a new car, a car was presented to me that was everything I wanted, except that it had leather seats and they were a $900 option, I told the dealership no deal.\n",
      "It was near the end of the model year and they counteroffered by not charging for the leather seat option.\n",
      "I took the deal and have over time come to like leather seats & now there are seat heaters & coolers.\n",
      "It's 100% amazing and worth every penny, including the 6 week wait to get the custom color interior along with the exterior color I desired.\n",
      "I had wanted originally the highest trim level of the Maxima, with the rear temperature controlled seats, but it only came in the Rackuda tan color interior.\n",
      "Now I have to after-market the seat heaters.\n",
      "It would be nice if the highest trim level came with other  interior color options.\n",
      "The passenger seat is not adjustable - which can be a problem for your passenger(wife).\n",

      "I expected a nice car like this to have an adjustable passenger seat.\n",
      "I test drove without my wife and purchased the car without realizing the passenger seat would not adjust up and down.\n",
      "My wife is not happy because of this seat issue.\n",
      "Second, the silver vent cover on the dash reflects onto the side windows, directly in line with the sideview mirrors.\n",
      "Aug 16, 2016You need to make the passenger seat adjustable up-and-down.\n",
      "For my wife, sitting in the seat is too low for her to see out comfortably.\n",
      "Blind spot near the driver outside mirror is large and offers a danger at night...Clearance between the front seats and console is too tight to retrieve items dropped...Lack of legroom in second row of seats is a pain...Adjusting dash lights while driving is difficult...unless you do it 1000s of times and can do it from feel and memory...Dragging your butt on the drivers seat upright will wear that material out fast...having to pick your feet up high to enter the car is difficult for older or handicapped individuals...the Bass is too limited on the radio.\n",
      "Jan 31, 2016The front bottom is too low and there needs to be a warning light and beeper when parking near cement curbs...or maybe just add curb feelers to the front lower area.\n",

      "High-quality, dependable, fun to drive, stylish.\n",

      "I feel like the other brands such as GMC offer more technology at the basic price level, such as, onstar, satellite radio, bluetooth technology.\n",
      "I would have liked a MUTE feature for the sound system.\n",
      "A mute feature is so much more convenient.\n",
      "I also think that the window/lock buttons on the drivers and passenger doors are too far forward causing you to have to lean forward to reach them.\n",
      "And if it isn't that easy to wire one in, maybe your engineering crew need a little shake up?\n",
      "Putting a 8inch (or whatever size it is) touchscreen stereo in the vehicle is useless if it's slow, doesn't have navigation, doesn't do Android Link/Auto or Apple Airplay.\n",
      "I love my 2016 Pathfinder, however it doesn't seem like it's a 2016 or a family vehicle, because it doesn't have Bluetooth, a USB port, or a backup camera.\n",
      "Great car, comfortable seats, easy to drive, quiet, great speakers, nice styling.\n",
      "I love the comfort of the front seats.\n",
      "I love the heated seats.\n",
      "And the heated steering wheel!\n",
      "Like everything about the vehicle except the material used for the dashboard...has an inexpensive look to it.\n",
      "Two items not equipped on the vehicle I would have paid extra to have were a back-up camera and side mirror sensors.\n",
      "The only recommendation I have is the improvement of the Blind Spot Warning (BSW) system needs more improvements and enhancement as well as outside noise reduction.\n",
      "Still miss the room I had with the Suburban, but find I can adjust because the Pathfinder is a more comfortable vehicle.\n",
      "Nice car, good gas mileage, comfortable, quiet, reliable, and safe.\n",
      "Jun 5, 2016The only issue is the front passenger airbag sensor and the airbags themselves.\n",
      "The sensor occasionally  indicates a child is in the seat when in reality a more than 200 pound adult is in the seat.\n",
      "Recirculate should be available in all modes of heating and air conditioning, especially when following diesel vehicles or when outside odors are not pleasant.\n",
      "Closer to the front window brace/dash.\n",
      "Make the power lift trunk /foot work better.\n",
      "One concern that I have is with the automatic start button.\n",
      "Yes, remote start should be standard, rear hatch should allow two separate openings.\n",
      "Window portion should open so cargo does not fall out of back when loaded full.\n",
      "I love my new pathfinder but I would like it even more with daytime running lights and high intensity headlights.\n",
      "The interaction between the Bluetooth and the phone is not very secure in functions and the leg room of the front seats are not very comfortable for a 6 ft person.\n",
      "Overall I am very satisfied with my car, I love the way it drives and so far seems to be a safe car.\n",
      "The tailgate does not have sensor to stop it from closing when someone is attending to the cargo area.\n",
      "Alert sounds are one low beep (lane change).\n",
      "I wish it came with an option to not have a 3rd row of seats - I don't need the 3rd row - I need the cargo room.\n",
      "I think that this SUV was created with ease of driving, visibility, and luxury in mind.\n",
      "The only drawback on this vehicle is the rear visibility, especially when the headrests are up on the 3rd row seats.\n",
      "My Pathfinder had a surprise bonus: a feeling of safety and security when driving it!\n",
      "They need to fix the sunroof design so that it's not so loud, my 2008 had a better design for that.\n",
      "Much more comfortable than older Nissan seats.\n",
      "Would like HID headlights and led daytime running lights, and more aggressive body style.\n",
      "Really like the Pathfinder's size, handling, looks but just wish it had better gas mileage on short trips.\n",
      "Perhaps seats that turn and lower to help us get inside the vehicle.\n",
      "Great vehicle, wish it add more advanced feature like automated braking, lane departure, etc.\n",
      "The headlights/taillights, cruise control, and electronics need updating.\n",
      "I wanted all the technology, comfort, and overall quality for the best price.\n",
      "Very good in the snow in 4 wheel auto.\n",
      "Interior micro cloth on door armrest easily shows dirt and oil stains from hand.\n",
      "I would like to have proximity sensors on front as well as rear.\n",
      "Excellent handling, towing capacity, seating, and features.\n",
      "The best feature, by far, is the 360 camera view.\n",
      "It is comfortable, easy to drive and very roomy.\n",
      "They love the comfort of the 2nd/3rd row seats.\n",
      "I am having trouble gauging how close to the lane lines I am.\n",
      "Lane assist would be an asset.\n",
      "Front door pillar creates a blind spot.\n",
      "The interior is designed for comfort.\n",
      "Roomy, comfortable, and fun to drive.\n",
      "Very roomy 3rd seating!\n",
      "My 80 lb dog rides comfortably in the back, there is more than enough room for grocery bags or plants & bags of dirt from the garden department.\n",
      "The hands free phone is a bonus, as I never answered my phone when driving.\n",
      "I love the back-up camera that lets me know it's safe to back up without hitting anything or anyone.\n",
      "The seats are reasonably comfortable, the glove box is a good size and plenty deep, I love that I can Bluetooth my own music when the radio is boring me.\n",
      "My husband has some pretty severe spine issues, and this vehicle has made him much more comfortable on longer rides.\n",
      "He's endured so much pain that I'd pay any price to make him more comfortable.\n",
      "The high-beam headlights on the Rogue are so much better than any headlights I've had on other vehicles.\n",
      "When you're driving on dark country roads with few houses and no street lamps, you need good headlights.\n",
      "My dad's wheel chair fits well in the back, and my mom says the back seat is very comfy.\n",
      "I was thrilled with the amount of room with the rear seats folded down, and so is my 80 lb.\n",
      "As a person who refuses to look at my phone while I'm driving, the Bluetooth feature has come in handy.\n",
      "Now the phone isn't a bother, it's a useful item again.\n",
      "I personally don't really need it as I have no intention of using Facebook or google in my car, but the map & navigation could come in handy if I'm able to use it, which I'm not.\n",
      "The engine is really loud - or so it seems - I run in Eco mode a lot but it always sounds like it's revving in order to accelerate.\n",
      "Plenty of space for 5 adults plus the back hatch area - had a nail in the factory tires for weeks before getting it patched.\n",
      "A few areas of improvement or issues I have:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- The navigation system only gives you the top down vertical view of where you are going.\n",
      "I would think that it's some sort of safety feature but it was so odd.\n",
      "I had to put my car in park, push the button again to open it all the way, then again to close it and wait for it to close before putting it in gear.\n",
      "- I wish I could even go higher on vertical adjustment of the driver seat.\n",
      "- The buttons on the left hand side (gas, ECO, Boost, etc) are very awkwardly located.\n",
      "- Nissan connect hasn't worked for me \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- And my BIGGEST pet peeve is that every time I accelerate - not matter what mode, how aggressive or not - the engine sounds like is revving and working very hard!\n",
      "I get on my fiancee for accelerating unnecessarily hard all the time because I want to be good to my engine and conserve gas efficiency.\n",
      "There's no way NOT to sound like you're putting the pedal to the metal.\n",
      "Some of my answers were not listed at the top for reliability and performance.\n",
      "I have not had any trouble and the longer it goes without any trouble, the more I will feel comfortable about the long term chances for reliability.\n",
      "Jun 6, 2016The design change for the interior coloring from the 2015 model to the 2016 model was terrible, but I found it was a consistent change across all models I was considering.\n",
      "You added more black onto the front dashboard and doors and took away the tan carpeting and tan steering wheel (making them black also).\n",
      "The CR-V sort of had a gray interior, but only really in the seat leather.\n",
      "Most of the dash, doors, carpet and all of the molded plastic in the hatch was black.\n",
      "Since I really didn't like the interior asthetics of either car, I ended up choosing the Rogue because the seats were much more comfortable, and the exterior design makes for a much prettier car.\n",
      "My biggest request, plea, suggestion etc would be to add gray to your interior color options!\n",
      "The leather seats are very nice, very comfortable but the drivers seat is already 'sagging' and was sagging since shortly after I bought it.\n",
      "The Rogue needs to have both the front passenger and driver windows auto up/down - not just the drivers window.\n",
      "Also the front passenger seat should be automatic as the drivers side is.\n",
      "The heated seats should be integrated into the touchscreen of the car.\n",
      "The speedometer should be able to be displayed in the center screen of the dashboard in number form.\n",
      "Positive: \r\n",
      "Rattle-free and I haven't had a single complaint on the quality of the Rogue.\n",
      "2) The folded-down back seats should lie flat, not slanted.\n",
      "3) The Rogue rear storage compartment platform inserts are too weak.\n",
      "Why did someone think the only thing you would want to store in the top of the center console would be a cellphone?\n",
      "Most of the time a cellphone is in your pocket or purse.\n",
      "The shape allows too little flat area for cargo.\n",
      "Also, the seats are a little short.\n",
      "Road noise is loud when you are accelerating but when I'm listening to my radio it's not that bad.\n",
      "Love the blind spot indicators in the mirrors and is a must with SUVs.\n",
      "Really like the heated seats and sunroof.\n",
      "Is cold on the floor but after the heat is on for awhile is fine.\n",
      "Gets good gas mileage, has a good sound system and I love the heated cloth seats and blind spot lights are a must when you have an SUV.\n",
      "It is just right for myself and you can see out so well when sitting in the back seat.\n",
      "It is very dependable, easy to drive, comfortable, lots of room for hauling things and is great on gas mileage!\n",
      "I would prefer the eco button to be easier to reach, like on the steering wheel.\n",
      "Also, the door jam is often in my line of site when turning curves.\n",
      "I feel like I have to stop or pull over to change the setting to ECO because it is a safety issue trying to change it while I am driving.\n",
      "The ECO button should be located next to the TRIP button (mileage per tank of gas), this location would allow ease of turning it on and off while driving and would allow me to get better gas mileage.\n",
      "Another item of concern is the material that my seats are made out of.\n",
      "From the first day I drove the car off the lot, the seats have indentations in them where I sit.\n",
      "I have been told that it is the material the seat is made out of and they are continuing to watch how the weather and my day to day sitting on them will effect the material and overall performance.\n",
      "Mar 23, 2016Wish the garage door buttons were lit up for easy access at night.\n",
      "Doors should be able to be locked with the button on the door while another door is open.\n",
      "The ability to have the vehicle honk after pressing the lock button twice.\n",
      "This can be very inconvenient for my neighbors since we live in the suburbs and our parking area is right next to their living-room window.\n",
      "Having to power on the vehicle to roll up or down the windows after a small amount of time is inconvenient because of the push start button.\n",
      "There should be some way to roll down or up the windows without having to press the start button then turn the vehicle back off.\n",
      "Lastly, there should be trigger in the passenger seat that will allow them to adjust the navigation settings.\n",
      "I understand the safety of the driver not being able to program an address into the GPS, but a passenger should be able to.\n",
      "My arm does not reach the middle console, and I have to constantly keep my hands on the steering wheel while driving.\n",
      "This is quite uncomfortable and tiring.\n",
      "I have used a pillow or other object to help, but the way this console is designed, this is what I would have to do.\n",
      "The driver's side mirror creates a blind spot.\n",
      "I have tried to elevate the seat which helps a bit, but the blind spot does exist when making a left turn.\n",
      "One of the best accessories on my 2005 Quest was the road illumination light that came on when the turn signal was used.\n",
      "Design it so that I can drive all day and be comfortable and not worry about missing an object on the left side that I did not see.\n",
      "Since I have only owned my Rogue since July, I have not had to use heat much or 'winter' features,  My former vehicle had heat/AC vents in different positions and I find the 2 center ones in my Rogue a little harder to control the direction of heat/AC.\n",
      "I also have issues with where the lock/unlock buttons are located (esp.\n",
      "on drivers side), which is under the door handle in the arm rest....again, not very convenient to use.\n",
      "Since they don't automatically unlock when you put the car in PARK without shutting it off, it's annoying to have to look to find the right button to unlock the doors.\n",
      "Sitting in the passenger seat, the wiper barely covers enough of that side of the windshield and not sure how that will be during the winter when it snows, etc.\n",
      "The driver''s seat it much less comfortable than I would like.\n",
      "I drove an Altima while my hood issue was being looked at and the seat was much more comfortable than my brand new Rogue.\n",
      "I drive alot, and many times for 2-3 hours at a time and I am not happy with the Rogue driver''s seat lack of cushion/comfort.\n",
      "Jul 7, 2016I find the drivers seat to be quite uncomfortable.\n",
      "I had an Altima as a rental and the drivers seat was SO much more comfortable than my Rogue seat.\n",
      "I LOVE the exterior styling and features, the gas mileage, and the power is great, especially with the sport button.\n",
      "Interior styling is nice.\n",
      "Would like to have center arm rests back for the front seats.\n",
      "Pay no extra money for the premium sound system.\n",
      "If you were, why would you continue to sell a premium sound system put in a car with basically no insulation and a very loud transmission and engine?\n",
      "Jun 5, 20161 - Why put a premium sound system in a car that is so poorly insulated from road and engine/transmission noise?\n",
      "2 - The 2.5L engine does not provide enough power - my wife's new RAV4 with the same size engine feels like it has twice the power and is much quieter inside\r\n",
      "3 - I run in the ECO mode all of the time and the fuel mileage is way below what was advertised and sold to me.\n",
      "Extra sound-deadening materials were sacrificed for fuel economy.\n",
      "The transmission is also very loud.\n",
      "It is a very good looking and comfortable vehicle with good room inside.\n",
      "This is the most expensive car we have ever purchased and it has been irritating to not connect to the handsfree system all the time.\n",
      "Also, the power drivers seat needs to have a tilt feature.\n",
      "The seats are very comfortable, but for the money, the passenger seat should have a power seat also.\n",
      "Most other vehicles in this segment have dual power seats and it would add a lot to the luxury and comfort of the vehicle.\n",
      "Sep 16, 2016I find the interior and exterior styling, as well as the technology, superior to others in its class.\n",
      "I am, however, still very unhappy with the persistent vibration in the steering column during city driving...usually between 1100-1500 RPM.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016The interior and exterior are excellent in the Rogue.\n",
      "My steering wheel and gas pedal vibrate considerably when traveling at speeds between 20-30 and 40-50 MPH.\n",
      "Love both the exterior & interior design.\n",
      "A few things I am not happy about: feel of the steering wheel - plasticky & cheap.\n",
      "Choose an area (safety or performance or design) and be the best.\n",
      "Only thing I don't like much is the front seat which is not very comfy & doesn't hold me well.\n",
      "The camera system is the best as is the cargo area.\n",
      "The seats are comfortable and easily adjustable.\n",
      "I only wish there was a drivers seat armrest that fit me.\n",
      "3 things I would change...the doors lock automatically after you go a certain MPH, but when you stop & put the vehicle in park you have to hit the unlock button if the vehicle is still running.\n",
      "I would like them to unlock when I pull on the door handle (like my husbands Ford Escape does).\n",
      "I would also love drivers seat arm rests that are attached to the seat.\n",
      "I also wish the drivers seat would raise higher up than it does.\n",
      "But the tires are cheap and may be causing the loud road noise inside the cabin at highway speeds, it can even be loud on anything less than super smooth roads.\n",
      "It may also be that there is no sound deadening material used in the vehicle?\n",
      "And when we shut the doors, it's like shutting a thin piece of cheap metal against the latch.\n",
      "The electronics, tires, and quietness are actually very disappointing for 25k.\n",
      "No armrests, rough riding and noisy, some time slow to pick up, some amount of visibility obstruction by both side mirrors are a few of the minus points.\n",
      "Also, more visible hazard signal switch/button with more noticeable color desirable.\n",
      "The switches on both front doors need to be positioned an inch backward ( under the inside door handle, it make difficulty to operate).\n",
      "May 9, 2016A few convenience are lacking in the Nissan Rouge, like armrests on both driver/passenger seat in front.\n",
      "Safe and reliable..good sound system...not very exciting to drive..good visibility.\n",
      "very difficult to get comfortable seating position to the steering wheel..steering wheel is uncomfortable to the hands.\n",
      "Oct 16, 2016Steering wheel and seat adjustments are hard to match up for maximum comfort.\n",
      "Steering wheel surfaces are too hard and rigid, pain on the hands and fingers to drive, always have to switch hands when driving to alleviate discomfort.\n",
      "I'm shocked I can't believe this has happened I don't know what to say $32,000 for a beautiful car and I can't leave the cooler plugged into all this technology overnight without waking up to a dead battery I can't run the radio what are we going to do about this Nissan.\n",
      "Again, interior colors of ONLY two options is ridiculous.\n",
      "I HATE black and white, so will consider trading for another vehicle simple because of interior colors.\n",
      "Aug 6, 2016Interior cloth seat covers should include more options....not just basic black or white, even tho  color NAMES are different.\n",
      "I wanted cloth seats but had to purchase leather (Murano) to get power lift....makes no sense to me.\n",
      "I am old and NEED power lift but do not want to pay for leather seats.\n",
      "Is roomy for passengers or hauling large items.\n",
      "Passenger seats are comfortable.\n",
      "The speakers vibrate when I play the music above 3.\n",
      "It sounds like the windows are slightly open.\n",
      "It sounds to me when I drive the right side windows are open.\n",
      "When I have a passenger, they mention it sounds like the driver side windows are open.\n",
      "The drive side visor is too large and not functional.\n",
      "When I put the visor down it blocks my view so I cannot even use it.\n",
      "I love the cameras, the style, the shape, the blue tooth phone capabilities, the seat heaters, and the navigation capabilities!\n",
      "I wish the red color was like the Ford's Ruby Red Metallic instead of Cayenne, but I still love that it's red.... Is there a way to make seats adjustable for short people or for women wearing pony tails?\n",
      "Nov 18, 2016I'm 5'4\" and the headrests on the front seats can get in the way of comfort.\n",
      "It is comfortable, well designed, easy to drive, and economical.\n",
      "A couple of things though about future engineering modifications: the emergency brake is too far to the right of the driver's side door, and it extends too far into the interior.\n",
      "The brake should be lower in the interior and closer to the door, so the driver doesn't snag his/her foot on it getting into the vehicle.\n",
      "Second, the passenger seat backrest vibrates visibly when the vehicle is idling.\n",
      "The vehicle is underpowered and could use features such as thinner backseats that would permit flat folding of the cargo area.\n",
      "A more powerful engine in the Rogue would be appreciated.\n",
      "The car could be a few inches shorter to make it easier to park,  although the overhead camera is a nice innovation.\n",
      "There should be a video to instruct and inform on how the protection system works in the SL version of the Rogue (lane warnings, etc., automatic braking).\n",
      "It's comfortable, reliable and has all the features I could ask for.\n",
      "The outside rear view mirrors automatically tilt downward when the car is placed in reverse.\n",
      "Camry' s back up camera was clearer and the cross traffic alert was better as well as the lane warning system.\n",
      "Good experience with it, with certain caveats - some things don't work well - nav system; some things have problems - phone, lane system.\n",
      "Android car doesn't work with my phone; nav system is not satisfactory - better off using GPS on phone; keeps dropping Bluetooth connection to phone; annoying announcements from car which I can't find out how to disable; rough suspension.\n",
      "The seats are really comfortable and the trunk capacity and ease to move things around is really nice.\n",
      "Mar 15, 2016The new vehicle I really like, and enjoy all the comfort and technology included.\n",
      "Not only it's a very smooth ride but also the fuel economy is superb in terms of mileage.\n",
      "Its interior as well as exterior is attractive.\n",
      "So far, it's quite a comfortable ride for me.\n",
      "Nissan Rogue has Bose speakers that provide an excellent sound quality to everyone inside the car.\n",
      "We love the interior, the Sirius radio XM, the moonroof, the leather seats, heated seats, rear seat AC vent, the Bluetooth connect, the rear storage stacked layers, the blind side warning light, the backup /all around view cameras, and love the ride.\n",
      "It rides well, looks good and gets good gas mileage.\n",
      "We also love the stereo system and navigation.\n",
      "The only thing I wish it had were memory seats so once I adjust the seats, I have a go back to mode when someone else drives it.\n",
      "My only problem with the design of this car is there is a HUGE blind spot, because the rear windows over the \"trunk\" area are way too small, as is the back windshield.\n",
      "I had to remove the headrest from the back seats in order to have any view out of the back of this car.\n",
      "Enjoy panaromic moonroof and safety features ... only negative is no 6 cyl option.\n",
      "Should have had a grey interior color scheme option.\n",
      "Interior light poor, Bluetooth phone connection complicated, uncomfortable vibrations during accelerations.\n",
      "Apr 17, 2016Terrible interior light, \r\n",
      "boring too long way to make call using voice command,\r\n",
      "doughy acceleration,\r\n",
      "annoying engine's vibration.\n",
      "It has a little bit of a cheap feel to it with all the molded plastic, and when you close the doors they sound hollow.\n",
      "Otherwise, it has a nice ride and the road noise is fairly low compared to others like it.\n",
      "The cargo area compartments are a little confusing, especially since the handles required are not included, but it serves the purpose.\n",
      "This vehicle handles well, roomy inside considering its size, transmission performs well.\n",
      "We like the engine power choices to conserve fuel.\n",
      "Jul 27, 2016Recall on air bag control in passenger seat.\n",
      "Steering wheel needs more adjustment capabilities.\n",
      "I am very disappointed with the coloring of the interior.\n",
      "I like an all tan interior, tan dash, tan carpeting/floor mats, steering wheel, etc.\n",
      "Also, I really think that all four door locks and window controls should be lit and visible at night.\n",
      "Safety issue: doors unlock automatically when engine is turned off.\n",
      "I was told that I could not change locks to manual operation, so that I could unlock the doors myself.\n",
      "When I pull into a parking space, I feel safer when doors remain locked until I choose to unlock them.\n",
      "a/c seats and push-button adjustable seats for both front seats, driver seat position memory buttons as well as the zero gravity front seats that are offered in the altima).\n",
      "I like the safety features, side warning, backup warning, around the camera, assisted driving, forward-looking at other cars with automatic braking.\n",
      "I like the kick lift , and button lift of the back.\n",
      "Front passenger seat should be power also.\n",
      "Jun 5, 2016Would've like heated seats, power front passenger seats, all four power windows and Bose speakers.\n",
      "I can't ride in the the back seat on the Rouge with out tilting my head to the side.\n",
      "For all the gadgets and options on this vehicle, there is not a heated steering wheel or a rearview mirror that has the upgrades.\n",
      "Love the new 2019, keep making your customers happy with even better safety and style.\n",
      "Interior design need to be inproved---coffee cup holders,  storage spaces, larger sitting area, leg room for driver,  more seat adjustments, more divided space in glove box\r\n",
      "Better tire readings.\n",
      "Need to include memory seat for driver seat and power seat for passenger seat.\n",

      "The heated seat buttons are poorly located in the center console.\n",
      "For the small engine size, which is gas efficient, there is a lot of power when picking up speed merging onto highways.\n",
      "Headrest is very uncomfortable, and I must use a pillow behind my back so my head doesn't protrude forward.\n",
      "This leaves my body further from the back of the seat and headrest, which is the opposite of what should happen for safety.\n",

      "The only very small issue  is when the wind hits it a certain way there is a loud hum/horn sound that comes from the driver side window.\n",
      "The engine is slightly under powered but it gets me from point A to B efficiently and comfortably.\n",
      "I would recommend providing more functionality with the included audio system in lower trim levels, including touchscreen capacity and app connectivity, especially with map apps.\n",
      "The rubber roof molding flew off the new vehicle while driving on the freeway one month after purchase.\n",
      "I was a little disappointed that piece flew off at such an early stage of owning the vehicle, and that the dealership would charge that much for a rubber roof molding when it's basically just a four to five foot rubber strip.\n",
      "There is a strange whistling from the passenger side mirror when it is windy out that makes it sound like something is wrong with the car.\n",

      "It is minor and has nothing to do with the performance and safety of the vehicle, and that is why I purchased the Subaru.\n",
      "I truly hope I never have to experience the safety features.\n",
      "Also having all electronics shut off when you turn off the engine is an amazingly poor designÃ¢ÂÂthe sound system should stay on until you shut the door, and the windows should operate for a short period of time (like almost every other car made in the last 10 years).\n",
      "Nov 20, 2016The entire system (windows, audio, windshield wipers) all immediately shut off when the engine is shut off, like when going to fill up with gas, which is an extremely poor design.\n",

      "Dec 11, 2016EZPass instructions differ from state to state AND the instructions for placement of the transponder run counter to the warnings issued by your Eye-Site technology.\n",
      "It would be helpful to your customers, I think, if YOU checked with the EZPass people to let them know your upgraded safety features (and presumably the safety upgrades on other auto brands) \"appear\" to conflict with their technology.\n",

      "I have to be driving at 20mph for the full light to show.\n",
      "I am not sure if this is a feature for city driving but I live in a rural area and there are dirt roads where the full headlight is needed but the speed of 20 mph is too fast for road conditions.\n",
      "I need to see far enough ahead on a hill to make sure all the deer are out of my dirt lane.\n",
      "Dec 3, 2016The one wish I have would be for self cleaning side mirrors as they do not shed water, or frost quickly so any use of the side mirrors is no existent for the first few miles after starting.\n",
      "Great in adverse weather, reliable, good finish, but a touch underpowered.\n",
      "Mar 22, 2016Interior of the car is great, but the interior plastics (ie, where the seatbelts lie when not in use) seem to scratch WAY to easily.\n",

      "Needs a more contemporary dash designÃ¢ÂÂsomething unique and not so bland, like a larger touchscreen with pinch adjustments.\n",
      "Needs more power and less engine noise, needs to operate on regular gasoline.\n",
      "I don't think there is a better price/value in this entire segment of vehicles when you consider the build quality, the features it possesses, and the reliability of the vehicle.\n",
      "My only complaint with this car is I would like to have better acceleration without going to six cylinders and jeopardizing the fuel economy.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016With the exception of the steering recall after having the vehicle for only three days, the experience with my Outback has been superlative.\n",
      "Jul 8, 2016The only hitch in my new car experience was having to bring the car back to the dealership after three days of driving it due to a steering recall.\n",
      "I do not get quality sound from the speakers.\n",

      "Also, adding a couple of lights in the rear cargo area.\n",
      "Having some down around where the wheel arches are I think would help greatly.\n",
      "We have the limited model, and it would have been nice to allow the passenger seat the same electronic controls for the seat as the 10-way adjustable driver seat.\n",
      "The car should have a smooth interface with smart phones so it can mirror the screen and people can use their preferred navigation and music apps.\n",
      "Oct 13, 2016I want Apple car play so I can use my preferred navigation apps and other search functions.\n",
      "The standard navigation system is not user friendly, and a redundant feature since the people that want to use them already have them on their phone.\n",
      "The vehicle has excellent interior workmanship and ride quality.\n",
      "Mileage and range on a tank of gas are in line with what are advertised and are outstanding for an AWD vehicle.\n",
      "AWD and high vehicle clearance are worthwhile features when visiting remote tourism sites.\n",

      "The bands mash the seat tops.\n",
      "Sep 19, 2016Dome light in the rear area should come on when you open the driver or any passenger door.\n",
      "Driving with the windows down isn't really practicalÃ¢ÂÂincredibly loud.\n",
      "The navigation system is a complete waste of money.\n",
      "A refurbished Garmin for $150 has far more features, is easier to use and free to update.\n",
      "The extra expense and loss of fuel economy is not worth the slight increase in power with the six-cylinder.\n",

      "The powertrain is powerful but accelerates slowly.\n",
      "I feel the touchscreen would be easier to use if it were closer and more vertical.\n",
      "The fan controls are hard to operate while driving since they very low on the console and hard to read with polarized sunglasses.\n",
      "It is a very safe vehicle and the Eyesight package is extremely helpful for safe driving.\n",
      "The car is very well equipped with the only omission being speed sensitive automatic door locks.\n",
      "The other issue we have is that the navigation and eyesight system sometimes sound random tones which have no connection to anything and no one at the dealership can explain this to us.\n",
      "Remote start on the 2016 Outback is inconvenient; the signal is weak; you must be very close to the vehicle to start it, and it turns off when any door or back hatch is opened, so the vehicle must be started twice.\n",
      "Would like ambient lighting in cabin, side mirrors that tilt down when the car is in reverse, a softer ride, quieter cabin, more information available on \"INFO\" segment of navigation such as \"Points of Interest.\"\n",

      "How about self-closing mirrors at the push of a button.\n",
      "Cooling and heating seats would be great.\n",
      "Subaru Outback is an exceptional vehicle that combines ultimate safety with comfort and versatility.\n",
      "It allows you to easily adjust passenger/cargo space as needed and creates a sense of confidence with outstanding safety features that provides an extra layer of awareness while driving it.\n",
      "We plan to travel using our Subaru \"to see more of the country,\" and we are looking forward to enjoying the ride!\n",

      "Dec 9, 2016I would like to have had the option to have light-colored floor mats, having black shows dirt and is hard to see when getting into the car.\n",
      "The vehicle lacks some items you might consider standard for such a highly priced car, including auto lock doors at speed or in drive, easy access seats, ability to get GPS Nav without the Eyesight technology.\n",
      "The vehicle is fun to drive, very comfortable, more than capable.\n",

      "Comfortable, safe, secure, high tech, dependable.\n",
      "The same for the seat heat controls.\n",
      "However, the radio/entertainment head unit is a great looking unit with the possibilities of performing as described but falls very short.\n",

      "The 4-wheel drive on my CRV makes my auto handle like a car.\n",
      "The turning radius is tight and the rear-view camera is outstanding.\n",
      "It has all the up-to-date technology that helps me stay connected yet safe on the road.I feel confident and safe driving this auto.\n",
      "This vehicle is everything I expected EXCEPT there is no way to turn off that extremely irritating seat belt warning.\n",
      "I will never buy another Subaru, no matter how much I like the vehicle, until you all put some switch in the vehicle where I can disable the seat belt warning noise.\n",
      "There are few things I am not completely satisfied with and need some improvements such as the size of the cupholders (fit reusable bottles), the heating system doesn't fully heat the vehicle/takes a long time to heat the vehicle, and the trunk is hard to shut (next time I will opt for a electronic trunk).\n",

      "I think Toyota has done an admirable job of compromise in designing this vehicle, especially in the areas of ride comfort vs. handling, and performance vs. fuel economy.\n",
      "I mentioned squeaks and rattles because there is an annoying one I believe emanates from the driver door which I will be addressing with the servicing dealer when I have it serviced next week.\n",
      "For instance, Camry lost the convenient holder in the trunk, my Avalon limited lost the fog lights and did not have the lights available on the touring.\n",

      "Just recently, while riding in the rear seat, I was unable to use the plug in for my phone, as they are very low and inconvenient.\n",
      "Two things I am very disappointed in:  The size of the back seat--our last Avalon had a very roomy back seat, big enough for 3.\n",
      "The new Avalon has been scaled down and the middle seat is EXTREMELY uncomfortable.\n",
      "The other big problem is that due to the battery (as i am told) there is a lot of heat coming up from the back seat seatbelt opening.\n",

      "Control of audio from my phone is poor.\n",
      "The tires have green value caps which suggests that they are filled with nitrogen but that was never mentioned at the dealer nor was I given any instruction on how to care for that process.\n",
      "The blind spot warning lights are good but there should be an accompanying audio signal (beep) if I start to change lanes with a car in the blind spot.\n",
      "Compared to the 2006 Avalon traded in, the 2016 is even quieter in the tire noise and wind noise areas, and it, again, rides as well as the older model.\n",

      "The front seating (both the driver and the passenger) has to be improved for comfort and adjust ability!\n",
      "The controls for the heater, the snow, and 4-wheel drive are neither very easy to use nor convenient.\n",
      "There's wind noise in the driver's side window, and I wish Toyota offered a six-cylinder engine.\n",

      "Has not yet mastered the automatic tailgate.\n",
      "Middle seats do not fold down flat, so not very good for hauling.\n",
      "Rear seats cannot be removed, and take up space.\n",
      "Fuel economy, handling, safety, and environmental engineering are all excellent.\n",
      "Regretfully, my overall experience has been seriously marred by the preposterous electronic information/control systems that are far too complex to be useful, operate, or customizeÃ¢ÂÂwith some incredibly stupid gaffes, such as inability to adjust the speedometer settings from MPH to KPH!Ã¢ÂÂand some awful design quirks such as the almost useless sun visors that cannot shield sun glare from the side (they are way too small), seats that are too low for short drivers (and cannot be sufficiently raised), very poor rear visibility made even worse by the \"decorative\" rear spoiler, severe lack of interior storage bin spaces (including no place to put a trash bin), a bunch of styrofoam that wastes sorely needed spare tire wheel well space below the hatch for emergency supplies and tools, an unadjustable hatch gate that opens too high making it very difficult to reach to close (and hits our open garage door), and extremely low ground clearance made much worse by the lack of even cursory bumpers (curbs wreck havoc on the thin plastic front end).\n",
      "I have been spending a lot of time making modifications to correct the deficits I can address: front and rear Neoprene bumper extensions, strap-on acrylic extensions for the sun visors, a pull-cord for the hatch gate, an extra notch in the front headrest posts to lower them as much as possible, a pad for the driver's seat to compensate for the low height, extra carrying hooks, and a suspended trash bag to improve interior storage, etc.\n",
      "Before you decide, check the interior carefully for poor design: no storage space, cramped rear seats, uncomfortable front seats.\n",
      "The safety features are awesome, but the interior needs an overhaul.\n",
      "Seatbelts are hard to fasten.\n",
      "Lengthen the \"stem\" where the belt clicks in next to the seat.\n",
      "Light color dash looks good but degrades use of side mirrors...dangerously.\n",
      "Aug 14, 2016Lack of interior storage and back seat legroom are serious negatives for 2016 Prius as compared to the 2007.\n",
      "More attention to comfort and convenience would top all the attempts to \"modernize\" the LOOKS of the interior.\n",
      "Sporty look (with poor seat comfort and storage) may appear to young drivers, but not to older drivers like us who want the safety features and have the money to buy top of the line.\n",
      "Maybe the top package could include upgraded seats, memory settings for seats, and even a softer ride.\n",
      "Steering wheel will not accommodate larger drivers.\n",

      "The tray in the center console needs to be redesigned to make it useful.\n",
      "All Priuses should have as standard the garage door opener.\n",
      "Prius is economical, environmentally friendly, new safety features and low gas mileage, good repair recovered, well designed, easy to drive.\n",
      "Besides above positive features: not well-designed dashboard computer system: too complex and more information and programs than needed; front end fender is too low: keep scraping curbs when I park; not enough glove compartment space.\n",
      "My responses regarding reliability are scored somewhat negative because I've had a recent problem with a rattle in the rear of the vehicle that sounds like a broken or failed part.\n",
      "(The rattle was combines with a burnt rubber smell, like the tires were being overworked).\n",
      "Therefore, the mileage does not reflect my regular driving habits.\n",
      "Good value, great gas mileage, reliability, and fun to drive.\n",
      "Jul 15, 2016Some of the color combinations were not as good when choosing interior/exterior.\n",
      "For example I wanted a dark gray exterior but this came with a \"BRIGHT WHITE\" interior panels.\n",

      "Apr 2, 2016I love the new safety features.\n",
      "The overall ride and performance are better than my 2007 Prius.\n",
      "Although overall I am enjoying my vehicle, I wish it was less complicated to use the electronics, like setting the clock.\n",
      "Jul 13, 2016There are three things I do not like about my new Prius, the first is visability from the drivers seat while looking in the passenger and behind passenger, the second is the complexity of the computer system, setting the clock, and finally there is no rear windshield wiper.\n",
      "I can drive for miles with the right turn signal on and not realize it because I did not take my eyes off the road to scan the far right side of the dash.\n",
      "Also the blind side warning on the two outside mirrors should also activate a audio chime inside the car.\n",
      "I have only had vehicle since early August and already showing some wear on drivers seat to edge most contacted when entering the car.\n",
      "Should have connection to garage door opener without going to the next package.\n",
      "My current car has no place to put a box of kleenex,  I have allergies and often need to use a kleenex and there is just no decent place to put them.\n",
      "I also think there should be garage door connectivity in all vehicles without major cost.\n",
      "The space where the tire went is filled with foam.\n",
      "In my 2009 I had more storage in the spare tire area of the car for my things.\n",
      "The amount of customization and information displayed really changes the way I drive.\n",
      "Knowing common driving practices absolutely burn fuel has changed the way I drive to be more aware of my fuel economy.\n",
      "I am not someone that likes spending much time in my vehicle, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the comfort, the ease of use, and the overall experience has exceeding my expectations when I made the decision to get a new vehicle.\n",
      "The problem I had with my vehicle was damage I caused to the door.\n",
      "One other thing I would like to mention is that I don't like the plastic used in the interior of my car - mostly the cupholders and phone charger.\n",
      "The charger is useless to me because I have an iPhone and I like to use it for navigation.\n",
      "In order to use it for Nav it has to sit on my dashboard, not between the seats.\n",
      "It has many well documented safety features and the best rated head lights on the market.\n",
      "Down side is that you hear a lot of road noise and the driver's seat is uncomfortable for anyone my height (74in).\n",
      "Bigger, sleeker and more safely features.\n",
      "I really wish they would integrate the use of Google Maps into the navigation.\n",
      "Also would love if while I am using my Android map that the voice would come over the car speakers and the Bluetooth would not block that.\n",
      "The new Prius is comfortable with great gas mileage and offers exceptional options for new driving safety packages.\n",
      "The new alarms and safety features are appreciated but difficult to adjust to as a new car.\n",
      "Nov 1, 2016Getting used to the navigation sensors is a little challenging but the safety is appreciated.\n",
      "It is reliable, gets great gas mileage, and is a pleasure to drive.\n",
      "Naturally there are things I had in the Lexus LS400 that I miss but that's to be understood...electric seat movement, automatic interior light turn on ( maybe it has it but 700+ pages to find out?\n",
      "We don't seem to call the car's components by the same name so it's a search), some things feel cheap because of thin gauge plastic and door/trunk weight etc.\n",
      "The one small problem I experienced and mentioned in the survey is a rattling that appears to come from the small vent at the driver's side of the windshield.\n",
      "Of the currently extra features I wish came standard, that is, at no additional cost, the electronic adjustment of the seat position is definitely at the top of my list.\n",
      "This is due to the high gloss paint/finish and the angle that the dash sits.\n",
      "This makes it very hard to drive safely at certain times.\n",
      "These are cheap looking and lower the overall quality look of the interior.\n",
      "Another annoying safety feature is the seat belt beep for the front passanger.\n",
      "I put boxes in the front seat and the vehicle thinks it is a person.\n",
      "Sep 14, 2016I love it, I love driving it, I know I can go places and save on gas, it is quiet which I love.\n",
      "2- sad that the passenger front seat has no power operation.\n",
      "There can be no excuse for a hatchback that costs $30,000 to not have a power lift gate!\n",
      "The Prius we bought is great but we almost never use the back seats so they remain folded down which leaves us about 2 feet in depth more cargo area than we need.\n",
      "My ideal car is the shell of a mini with the smooth ride and technology and reliability of a Prius.\n",
      "My Prius is entirely trustworthy, safe for my family, and surprisingly useful as an all-purpose runabout.\n",
      "The Prius is superb at its stated mission of being a real car while still delivering excellent fuel economy, and it's surprisingly useful with the hatchback.\n",
      "My Prius does not have it and had to drive in Canada using a separate GPS unit that had kilometer reading to get accurate speed readings.\n",
      "The only things I would like to improve on are 1) I wish the driver's seat could go up just a tad bit higher.\n",
      "The technology and the economy available through the use of three separate driving modes makes it a most efficient automobile.\n",
      "I don't feel comfortable with the quick braking response of the Prius.\n",
      "The middle console would be better for my fit if the door opened from the right instead of the left.\n",
      "Excellent gas milage, ride and safety features.\n",
      "I think the Econ display helps me be a better driver and get the best mileage.\n",
      "When buying the 2016 Toyota Prius, get at least the Package 4 to enjoy all the technology and safety features available.\n",
      "Still too much vibration when riding with window/s down.\n",
      "Something around my dash rattles and buzzes right off the lot.\n",
      "Please include a spare tire and fog lights standard for highest trim line.\n",
      "Prius front seats are the most uncomfortable seats for long trips that I  have ever had in a Toyota product.\n",
      "Lots of safety features.\n",
      "The model is still quite low in the front - it is the one exterior feature I'd like to change.\n",
      "Also , the white console is my least favorite feature.\n",
      "The back hatch does not seat properly and makes the car sound like a 10 year old car.\n",
      "It's well put together and the technology package is quite useful and adds to the safety of the vehicle.\n",
      "The car with its safety features is very enjoyable.\n",
      "Storage, ability to carry passengers, MPG, headlight strength, ease to drive, comfort.\n",
      "Please add self-driving features (not just driver minders) when possible.\n",
      "Efficient, reliable, long lasting, good maintenance record, fun to drive.\n",
      "Excellent ride, fun driving,  steers great, great on gas, will never buy another type of car.\n",
      "It is very difficult to plug it in when you are sitting in the seat because it sits so far back.\n",
      "The ride is improved over the older models, and it handles like a dream.\n",
      "Best vehicle on the market today for gas milage, resale, and reliability.\n",
      "Would like support for Android Auto in Prius 2.\n",
      "Technologically advanced, great gas mileage, worry-free performance.\n",

      "It saves me so much money on gas!\n",
      "Great gas mileage, outstanding GPS.\n",

      "On the subject of the hybrid system, the use of a lithium ion battery could have flattened out the cargo space or given you more battery to go further on battery only mode.\n",

      "It's too close to the fan button, and I worry about turning the wrong button as I am driving.\n",

      "Give it a bigger engine with more power, I mean its almost a full-size truck.\n",
      "Overall, the truck isn't bad, but there are two very glaring problems, the transmission is horrible and a perceived lack of power.\n",
      "The transmission is CONSTANTLY hunting for gears and is very annoying on long trips, constantly downshifting/upshifting, etc., which leads to the perceived lack of power.\n",
      "If the transmission was better and the power there I would definitely recommend this truck, until these are fixed though, I cannot recommend it and will most likely not buy out the lease, like I was hoping when I first purchased the vehicle.\n",

      "Safety features were made part of nonessential packages (e.g., Bluetooth).\n",
      "How about a model that stresses a functional work vehicle including safety features.\n",
      "I mean, promoting the Tacoma as a hip, happening off-road, performance vehicle shortchanges people who want a reliable work truck priced lower because it doesn't have the latest social media technology integrated.\n",
      "When I turn on the headlamps, the illuminated touch switches on either side of the display screen darken, and I cannot see them during the day.\n",

      "The radio crashes all of the time when using Android Auto.\n",
      "Include garage door functionality.\n",
      "Do not get the 19\" wheels and low profile tires unless you plan to rally.\n",
      "The suspension and performance characteristics are readily tunable from the dashboard.\n",
      "Great overall car: very quick, handles well, gets decent gas mileage, great interior and looks nice.\n",
      "Negatives: Turning radius is larger than you would expect, and I wish 6th gear was longer for better fuel mileage on road trips.\n",
      "Also, why can't the center armrest console open and ratchet like the GTI?\n",
      "Everything is awesome, I've come from more expensive cars and love driving this one, I just wish they'd fix the armrest, cargo space issue on the US version, because why should the rest of the world get an adjustable armrest and not us?\n",
      "Seats do not have cushion angle adjustments like past VWs I've had, I wish it did.\n",
      "Using the Android Auto head unit, it's great, but doesn't always connect to phone without intervention.\n",
      "Sound quality of speakers is lacking though.\n",
      "Deciding factors for my purchase were price, Android Auto head unit, fuel mileage, heated seats, and manual transmission in no particular order.\n",
      "Make the Park Assist feature optional.\n",
      "I despise the backup camera and the infernal beeping that accompanies it; there really needs to be an option for the car to not beep at me every time I turn it on - it's making me hate starting the car.\n",
      "The doors have \"stops\" when opening that are inconvenient.\n",
      "In other words, when you open a door, the first stop isn't wide enough to let people out, and the second stop is so far out that the door hits other cars in parking lots.\n",
      "The doors won't stay in any in-between positions, they tend to swing to one of the two stops.\n",
      "It is smooth and is amazing to drive with more than enough power for my needs.\n",

      "My 2011 Jetta SEL was able to unlock all four doors when using keyless entry on front passenger side.\n",

      "Would recommend they get:  navigation and back-up camera as well as a windshield wipe for rear window.\n",
      "However, I am sorry I did not get the back-up camera... that is a blessing in ANY car!\n",

      "Reflections off the chrome trim on the dashboard reflect in the rear view mirror, making it difficult to see clearly.\n",
      "Better soundproofing and avoidance of tire noise would enhance the ownership experience.\n",
      "Mar 22, 2016Great car overall, fantastic engine and transmission, but on the latest tech part it's seriously behind the Japanese and Korean manufacturers.\n",
      "I was disappointed that certain features that are standard in most cars, such as automatic headlights and climate control, are not standard in VW vehicles.\n",
      "My past Volkswagen was an amazing vehicle and the new technology that are in the new ones make it even more exciting and better handling and also a very exciting car to look at and own.\n",
      "Please offer this trim level with HomeLink rear-view mirrors, full leather seats and memory settings for the driver's seat, mirrors and steering wheel cluster.\n",
      "It has all the features I want and all the features that I need to be comfortable in a car.\n",
      "The side view assist and back up camera is extremely helpful in maneuvering my vehicle.\n",
      "I can understand why carplay or power-adjustable seats are available only on premium trims, but why is Lumbar support considered a non-essential \"luxury\".\n",
      "Please put the gas light on the side where the gas is supposed to go in instead of putting it on the opposite with a little arrow on the other.\n",
      "please make the seats more comfortable.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016I wish the seats were more comfortable and the headlights brighter.\n",

      "The sun visor on the drivers side (as well as passenger side) is way too short to block the sun when you are behind the wheel.\n",

      "The driver seat was ok for a few thousand miles now it sucks.\n",

      "The VW Passat SEL has fantastic technology (ex: adaptive cruise control that auto tracks vehicle ahead, Apple CarPlay, auto on/off wipers, auto collision alert with auto breaking, blind spot alert, keyless touch entry just to name a few...).\n",
      "As great as the VW Passat SEL is, it needs the following: quieter tires; the one-touch seat position button selection should be one touch when door is closed not just when door is open (when door is closed you have to hold the button until seat reaches position); and the garage door open/close buttons should also work before you start or after you stop the engine (it is dangerous to have to start the car before you can open the garage door or keep the car running to close the garage door).\n",
      "The USB port for Apple CarPlay should be more easily accessible in multiple places on the dashboard, not hidden next to the car charger behind a door.\n",
      "I had to run a 6' cable  behind the dashboard to mount my smartphone on the driver side AC vent without the ugly cord being draped from the open door across the steering wheel to the mount.\n",
      "Make the SEL available without sunroof, Florida sun and heat prevents its use.\n",
      "Trunk-opening VW symbol was easier to use.\n",

      "There was trunk access from the backseat.\n",
      "The 2007 model had classic round tail lights, which are more stylishÃ¢ÂÂthe 2016 tail lights look like all the other cars on the road.\n",
      "Nov 2, 2016The direct fuel injection engines should have a fifth throttle body fuel injector to wash the intake valves of oil that cokes on from PCV oil mist.\n",

      "Very roomy and comfortable backseat for guests.\n",
      "Heated seats front and back!\n",
      "Great lumbar support.\n",
      "There should be a gap in the armrest and center console for wiresÃ¢ÂÂfor instance when using the plug for CarPlay and/or charging devices, if you close either tightly, the cable gets pinched.\n",
      "Front seats need a bit more bolstering but overall excellent design and build quality, and drives like a tank and rails...if upgraded wheel package available to go to 18 rim with 235 tire versus 215-17 most likely would have considered and would have been willing to pay a premium over tirerack prices for the convenience of picking it up that way with factory rims and upgraded tires.\n",
      "Jan 28, 2016Great driving car, seats could be a bit more bolstered, need to offer backup sensors in this model level.\n",
      "Excellent fuel economy, solid build, exceptional and traditional interior.\n",
      "Would like more interior color options.\n",
      "For example, black interior with tan seating or black interior with dark red seating.\n",
      "Only issue I have is there is a small rattle from under the passenger seat going over bumps.\n",
      "VW needs to make a 6-speed manual transmission available on the Passat gas engine.\n",
      "However, the amount of air you can hear coming through the windows is more than my old 2003 Toyota Camry, and I do not enjoy that noise when I have the radio off.\n",
      "Also be aware that your door speakers will rattle when you have a bottle in the cupholder.\n",
      "Not sure what the point of having the holder placed there if it will affect the sound of my speaker.\n",
      "It has plenty of power for getting in and out of traffic and is very comfortable to ride and drive.\n",
      "For instance I am 6'2\" and have more than enough room in the front and rear seats.\n",
      "The trunk is large and can haul a great amount of cargo Fun, reliable car while also feeling like you are driving a more refined sedan.\n",
      "Console restricts leg room for right leg while driving; find myself leaning my get on console side.\n",
      "Turn Signal and wiper lever are very close to steering wheel; sometimes I hit them while making turns or moving my hands along the wheel.\n",
      "Jun 11, 2016Turn signal lever and Wiper lever are too close to the steering wheel.\n",
      "Excellent choice for the money: good combination of engineering, safety, performance, driving dynamics and technology.\n",
      "Oct 26, 2016I am very pleased with my new car, but two options would have made it perfect: readily available remote start (dealer installed) and all wheel drive option.\n",
      "A VW is a well designed vehicle with current safety technology that provides reliable cost effective transportation.\n",
      "When I try to find faults with the Passat I really can't find any but I would really like to see cooled seats in my new VW.\n",
      "There was a rattle in the dash, which was repaired.\n",
      "And there is a rattle in the driver's door, which, although the dealer tried to repair, is still evident and needs to be done again.\n",
      "In this day and age that feature (to me), should be a given in a remarkable brand car, along with the backup camera warning signal.\n",
      "It came with an outdated manual for sound, navigation, infotainment, etc.\n",
      "Sometimes it does, but often  I just use the phone's speaker.\n",
      "I have not used the navigation system, but I would if I could figure it out.\n",
      "I am sorry that my vehicle does not include a \"key memory\" that ties my key to the seat position I prefer when driving (as compared to my spouse).\n",
      "Great fuel economy, quiet and easy to drive.\n",
      "It provides a better, more comfortable, and quieter ride than my 2013.\n",
      "I dislike the interior trim, especially the fake Formica look wood   seating is very comfy for all occupants.\n",
      "Would like the front passenger seat to fold flat/forward.\n",
      "It's comfortable for me to drive and for my passengers.\n",
      "It has helpful safety features and excellent technology integration.\n",
      "Make the iPhone interface more reliable.\n",
      "Body side guards, to help from getting door dings and dents, should be made available on the car.\n",
      "Only thing things that would make it perfect:  A TDI engine; A manual transmission option; An auto-dimming mirror with HomeLink.\n",
      "May 5, 2016Shoddy workmanship, interior rattles and creaks.\n",
      "The VW Passat with technology (TSI) is an exceptional value.\n",
      "It drives extremely well, both smoothly and comfortably.\n",
      "The transmission is finicky and there seems to be no \"gray\" area as far as it's either gas on or harsh braking feeling...no sort of coasting per se.\n",
      "Best value that I could afford for its reliability, comfort, and economy.\n",
      "It is a sensible, sporty, and reliable vehicle, which offer safety and extreme comfort for the driver, I love the car.\n",

      "The ride and handling are exceptional for a four-door sedan.\n",
      "Do not buy a diesel Volkswagen until they get it right with good fuel milage and power.\n",
      "Very reliable car and the safety and security features are awesome and works perfectly on time.\n",
      "Its features and style resemble a luxury car and it has great performance and fuel efficiency.\n",
      "Would like to charge my cellphone even when car is shut off.\n",
      "Make sure the vehicle is safe, reliable, and fun to drive.\n",
      "Great vehicle, fun to drive, economical comfortable.\n",
      "Reliable, comfortable, good leg room, great trunk spack.\n",
      "Love the heated seats.\n",
      "The only disappointments are that my Tiguan SEL did not come with LED Headlights and my side and rear view mirrors are not auto dimming type for nighttime driving.\n",
      "Also, I was extremely disappointed that a recent recall affects the ambient lighting feature of our Tiguan.\n",
      "This recall, according to VW, requires that the ambient lighting feature be disconnected by the dealer until a fix is found.\n",
      "Ambient lighting was one of the features I really liked and paid for but now I am having to do without it for who knows how long.\n",
      "The fresh-air system appears to heat the air before it enters the cabin even though the temperature dial is set to the coldest setting.\n",
      "The safety feature that prevents you from opening the door (to check for vehicle parking alignment) without engaging the emergency brake is annoying.\n",
      "Comfort, roomy, safety.\n",
      "Love my vehicle, wish that the color of the dark green had been available with the features I got in the blue Tiguan i ended up purchasing.\n",
      "Don't.\n",
      "VW's price/quality ratio is getting worse.\n",
      "It feels solid and safe, it drives smoothly, the interior is very quiet on all road surfaces.\n",
      "Engine is powerful with very good fuel economy, I averaged around 28.5 MPG in mixed driving on regular gas.\n",
      "Front seats are very comfortable and supportive, interior is very roomy: it has the largest front header room and  rear leg room in this category.\n",
      "It has much more standard features like BLIS, GPS, cross traffic warning, glass sunroof, leather interior, automatic rear sun shed etc at a lower price.\n",
      "The car's exterior looks elegant with 18\" wheels, I noticed this car one day when I was driving behind one, its rear design impressed me, and I started to research this car and decided to purchase one after that.\n",
      "The space behind dashboard can not be effectively used , the hole on the arm rest on doors should have a bottom so things like cellphone etc can be put inside it.\n",
      "Aug 25, 2016Interior material sometime has small cracking or rattling sound, especially when start to drive the car after the car has been parked under sun for hours.\n",
      "Solid ride and performance, nice look, sporty, unique, stands out from all other cars, and very safe.\n",
      "I would have liked to have more color and package option at the dealer, and more AWD options.\n",
      "I am also somewhat unhappy with the seat belt warning, or lack thereof.\n",
      "I buckle my seat belt anyway, but if I did not, the car would drive without giving me any warning anyway.\n",
      "I would have thought that, of all cars, Volvos would be more progressive than that and be particularly aggressive in reminding the driver to fasten their seat belt.\n",
      "Most cars will chime until you fasten your seat belt.\n",
      "It is annoying, but one of the best safety features any car can have.\n",
      "I am particularly impressed with Volvo's overall corporate commitment to safety and reliability.\n",
      "My only real disappointment is with the navigation system which I find to be antiquated, particularly with regard to entering destinations and to other ease of use issues.\n",
      "Use of Android Auto or similar system would be preferable.\n",
      "On the other hand I like the safety and economy features - including the cruise control, following distance, automatic braking, engine off on stop, and so forth.\n",
      "Jul 25, 2016Overall, I am very satisfied with the S60, BUT I find the Sensus Navigation system difficult to use.\n",
      "The option to change systems - either to Android Auto or to Waze -  would be a great relief.\n",
      "Also needed - an option to handle more than one bluetooth connection at a time (say 2 cellphones or 1 phone plus 1 headset).\n",
      "While I am somewhat indifferent about the exterior styling, the interior is a knockout!\n",
      "The seat design and appearance/color coordination/ wood/ interior design on this car are all excellent and the best of all four (Including an Audi and Mercedes!)\n",
      "If this were to be a car that I would use everyday I would have optioned the xenon headlights and the Harman Kardon stereo.\n",
      "The version of Sensus in this car is hard to use-  the MMI technology in my Audi is much easier to use and figure out- the new Sensus in the S90 looks much better than the S60's.\n",
      "I mean it always seems to take longer routes and illogical routes-  I have compared the routes chosen in the Volvo with my other car's built in navigation systems and Volvo's is off-  A very safe, sensible, and excellent vehicle!\n",
      "Power: From 0 I'm not very impressed, but acceleration from a rolling start is excellent.\n",
      "What truly had me at the test drive was the handling and steering responsive.\n",
      "The rear of the vehicle boasts a beautiful tail light display.\n",
      "Excellent comfort, steering and handling, and quality fit and finish.\n",
      "Good gas mileage for the powerful engine it has.\n",

      "Oct 30, 2016My wife and I absolutely love the quality, comfort, safety, and style of our new S60.\n",
      "We are very disappointed that the S60 continues to have insufficient rear seat legroom, except for the Chinese version, which does not have all the desired options.\n",
      "Only downside is that the infotainment/navigation system is a bit dated, not particularly intuitive to use.\n",
      "I feel that the dealerships should offer a course or instruction in the use and function of the many features of the vehicle - many of which are NOT listed or shown in the printed owners manual that is supplied with the car.\n",
      "Not helpful when seated in the vehicle and wanting to learn something while in the vehicle.\n",
      "Nov 30, 2016I am thrilled with the styling, build-quality and comfort of the car itself but disappointed at the complexity of operating the navigation system and other infotainment options.\n",
      "The Volvo is solid, but comfortable to drive.\n",
      "It handles well and has a quiet interior,  In sveeral months of driving I have not encountered a single problem with the vehicle.\n",
      "The GPS/Map function is difficult to use.\n",
      "My former car, a Chevy Malibu, offered a much more straightforward voice interface for cell phone use.\n",
      "Feb 23, 2016The GPS in my Volvo does not compare in ease of use or accuracy of directions to the WAZE free app I use on my smart phone.\n",
      "I have stopped using the Volvo GPS completely.\n",
      "The opening in the driver side arm rest should be closed on the bottom so this space can be used to store a phone while driving.\n",
      "Door locking and unlocking system has glitches.\n",
      "Door opens too readily from outside when near to car often unlocking car after it was locked.\n",
      "Conversely the remote range to click open is limited when wanting to use in garage to load car.\n",
      "Trunk release doesn't always work with remote and requires effort to lift up, not helpful when loading car.\n",
      "Despite camera system there is a bad blind spot for lower or smaller stationary objects for outer lower rear bumper and I unfortunately found it when I hit something!\n",
      "Cup holder location is awkward for transmission shifter and hand position.\n",
      "Car is easy to drive and features are very intuitive.\n",
      "It is very comfortable, safe, and made of high quality materials (inside and out).\n",
      "I wish the Stop/Start default setting could be changed, so it isn't on during drives where I won't be stopped long in traffic; the times where the engine shuts off for half a second and turns back on (because the car thought I was coming to a complete stop) are annoying--so I typically always turn the feature OFF when I first get in the car--and only turn it on when coming upon a long traffic light.\n",
      "/  Seats are amazing!\n",
      "Floating dash is very simple to use, but needs a redesign--along with the rear end of car.\n",
      "Thank you, Volvo, for making a roomier back seat in the Inscription--and for not shortening the roof in the back seat (as this makes it easy for my 6' passengers to get in/out of back seat).\n",
      "I love the BLIS and rear traffic alert...and lane departure..and automatic wipers...etc.\n",
      "It does not handle in any way shape or form like a sports car it has a stiff ride with lots of body lean.\n",
      "The onboard radio computer not intuitive and downright difficult \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The headlights leave something to be desired,Just not powerful enough.\n",
      "They should offer additional driving and or fog lights to help augment their week headlights and to give the owners a chance to customize a very boring car.\n",
      "I love the ride; it's looks; it's comfort for front and back passengers; and all the luxury that comes with a car that uses regular gas.The apps on the infotainment system often don't download even though I have signed in correctly.\n",
      "I like the ability to use my thumb on the steering wheel to move around in the infotainment system.\n",
      "Great available safety features.\n",
      "Good handling and reliability.\n",
      "Jul 10, 2016The engine stop feature (to save fuel) can be somewhat annoying, particularly on short trips around town.\n",
      "Nice to be able to set a timer (in addition to the \"off\" button) as to when it might shut down, or maybe an AI program to figure that out automatically.\n",
      "Otherwise, like the overall safety features (lane change alert, front and rear collision alert, side alerts, cruise features, etc.\n",
      "As I have become acquainted with the system on the Outback I use the features more frequently.\n",
      "I would prefer the ability to connect my phone to the car and view Google maps on the screen.\n",
      "The car itself is almost perfect - I don't like the auto shut-off feature that cuts the engine out a stops.\n",
      "The doors are a little heavy to open and keep open.\n",
      "The release feature is loud, the trunk door is heavy and it needs to be slammed in order to close securely.\n",
      "Part of the reliability and safety sections of the survey reflects my recent issues, and the fact that it hasn't been fixed is because it is a new issue and I just scheduled the appointment.\n",
      "Car is a blast to drive and comfortable and elegant and I believe under the radar and underrated.\n",
      "Only problem is that the rear view mirrors don't work well and need to be adjusted--which I will do at my first service.\n",
      "This is my second Volvo S60 and I love it, it is comfortable, stylish, has a great ride and is fun to drive.\n",
      "For the manufacturer: the door handles need to be redesigned as fingers are easily pinched if not careful when opening the door.\n",
      "I don't care for the door handles on the new Volvo, it's easy to pinch a finger.\n",
      "I used to have an Audi and now realize how much I liked that th Audi would hold the cruise control speed on steep downhill inclines.\n",
      "Nothing's worse than having to ride your brakes.\n",
      "Knowing my rights for correcting such an expensive feature is pivotal so I called the NC Attorney Generals office.\n",
      "I requested a final private meeting with the Owner at which time I suggested we ride together to again attempt to prove my technological challenges.\n",
      "I drive on North/South highways a lot and in the early morning or late after noon, I can not get the sun visor to block the sun.\n",
      "After coming out of an Audi, there are things I miss about the car that I wish the Volvo had:\r\n",
      "Audi has standard HID headlights, instrument panel indicates date, Audi ride seemed as agile, but yet smoother over bumps.\n",
      "The voice commands on the Volvo are antiquated and hard to use.\n",
      "Oct 21, 2016Overall I love the Volvo, the ride, and the safety.\n",
      "My metallic black 2016 Volvo S60 T5 Premier has the factory Sports Package which includes paddle shifting, 19\" x 8.5\" wheels, lowered and stiffer suspension and thicker torsion bars.\n",
      "I added factory heated front sport bucket seat.\n",
      "Safe, sporty, good handling, mid-size 4-door sedan that looks and drives great with excellent mpg.\n",
      "However, the heat takes a little time to get started enough to feel warm.\n",

      "Very satisfied with the fuel economy I am achieving and the overall comfort, especially with the sport contour seats.\n",
      "Mar 29, 2016Of the things I went back to the dealer for, the most serious was a instrument panel warning of \"Steering malfunction - Stop the vehicle in a safe place,\" which ultimately tied up the vehicle for almost three weeks and required removal/replacement of the entire steering gear.\n",
      "This warning was very disconcerting, and no explanation ever given for its seriousness, as the car still steered as usual.\n",
      "There is a recurring problem with warning chimes sounding (and the radio volume being reduced while they do) and no indication is given as to why.\n",
      "I have had to shut off the lane departure warning system as it seems to occasionally intervene when I am clearly between the lines.\n",
      "Finally, the engine stop/start feature is poorly thought out, engaging when entering the garage or in parking spaces and forcing me to always be conscious of whether I need to turn it off.\n",
      "Ideally, it would use the front cameras to recognize traffic lights where it would be most useful.\n",
      "Since almost all of the issues I have with the car are software related (I suspect the steering malfunction may also have been a software problem), Volvo needs to consider a way that software updates can be conveniently and proactively installed in customer's cars since these systems do not appear to be tested nearly well enough to avoid customer frustration with the product.\n",

      "Interior styling is OK.\n",

      "The Sensus car connect system needs better engineering and better training of the dealer in setting it up.\n",

      "The exterior styling and tinted windows along with all-wheel drive made my choice easy when comparing it to the standard V60.\n",

      "Finally Volvo has matched safety and design with technology.\n",
      "Back up camera is outdated, and limited usefulness.\n",
      "Exterior door handles catch hand and pinch.\n",

      "4.\n",

      "Gas pedal depression to reaction time of the vehicle is a little slow and could use some improvement Jul 3, 2018HIGHLY recommend reconfiguring the wireless charger - gets too hot very fast so stops charging, needs ventilation to work properly.\n",

      "The car is extremely safe and comfortable to drive.\n",
      "Although I LOVE this car, there's a few things that bug me:\r\n",
      "1) LED interior lights should ALL change color when selecting among color choice options.\n",
      "I thought 1 bulb was burnt out but dealer said each light turns off when wheels are turned.\n",
      "Also why only 1 red fog light in rear of car?\n",
      "3)  Luxury car should have an electric adjustable steering wheel to tilt up/down and telescope in/out.\n",
      "Then memory buttons could change the steering wheel along with seat and side mirrors for different drivers.\n",
      "4)  Backup camera takes too long to come on when you put car in reverse.\n",
      "5)  All the buttons require a nano-second too long to react, such as remote opening rear hatch, or activating any of the choices on the navigation screen.\n",
      "6)  Automatic rain sensor wiper feature is too fussy.\n",
      "8) Put electric power on the second row seats to make it easier to fold down when loading in the trunk.\n",
      "You don't use that color in your online ads or printed brochures.\n",
      "I had to drive 8 hours to find an XC60 in a color (Denim Blue) that I liked (Denim Blue was 2nd choice; Red was 1st choice; Black was 3rd choice; Pine Gray never an option!).\n",

      "My wife likes this car but wishes it had more power and less road noise.\n",
      "There should be more exterior and interior color options .\n",
      "In my 2015 XC60 I could change temperature, seat heater, fan speed  - virtually anything - with just a quick glance, or without taking my eye off the road at all.\n",
      "My 2018 Inscription is missing features that I had on my 2015 - such as interior driver storage space, rear storage area flip-up that would hold grocery bags and keep them from sliding around.\n",
      "The car is comfortable and mechanically well engineered.\n",
      "The interior electronics (ie controls and the touch screen) are a confusing mess and not well designed / engineered.\n",
      "The navigation option was a waste of money - I just use my phone navigation as those apps are much easier to search and use.\n",
      "I find the interior climate and audio controls non-intuitive and non-tactile to the point of dangerous driving distraction.\n",
      "The goal seems to be on selling services - (ie Sirius and Volvo On Call) vs instead of safely integrating with the phones we all carry.\n",
      "A few suggestions for future design modifications:\r\n",
      "- While the key fob is handsome, a color coding (or other approach) of the buttons on the side would facilitate knowing which key performs what function.\n",
      "- Although I followed instructions and repeated steps several times, I cannot get car to recognize the second key fob associated with driver #2\r\n",
      "- The remote rear lift gate (using your foot) does not work consistently\n",
      "This car is a pleasure to drive with a nice mix of styling, comfort, and technology.\n",

      "It is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever been in and the smoothest and safest ride on the road.\n",
      "I never felt that a vehicle was very important to me as long as it had four wheels and got me where I needed or wanted to go UNTIL I drove my Volvo.\n",

      "My point-of-view is that this function, in some cases, doesn't function well and in other cases is just plain defective.\n",
      "Defect: I have many times when the green steering wheel is lit, but the car will cross the lines.\n",
      "These are not situation where there may be multiple lines that may be confusing, but just simple lane lines.\n",
      "Even when the car does stay within the lines, the steering is quite jerky.\n",
      "It doesn't follow the lane smoothly and in the center.\n",
      "Yes, I know we are having our hands on the wheel, but a little warning would be nice.\n",
      "I understand that there can be differences in the quality of the road markings or lighting, but I see this happen on the exact same road, same quality of markings and same lighting.\n",
      "I was trying to reject from the steering wheel.\n",
      "On some roads, these tires produce a very irritating high pitch noise.\n",
      "Now we have to live with these tires and noise for the next 4-5 years because there is no option from dealer to swap these out.\n",
      "(or pay a lot of extra money to replace brand new tires) You should either switch to Pirelli or give you customers an option.\n",
      "Charged for heated windshield\r\n",
      " \r\n",
      "Why does Volvo charge the same price for the climate packing in the US with or without the HUD.\n",
      "If you order the HUD, you cannot get the heated windshield, but there is not credit for this.\n",
      "The heated windshield is a $300 option in the OSD pricing.\n",
      "Waiting for doors to close before I can lock\r\n",

      "Backup camera is slow.\n",
      "I used the steering wheel controls (O -OK) to select.\n",
      "Here is a scenario with the backup camera...\n",
      "The camera (set to 360 degree mode) doesn't seem to be ready by the time I get in, close the door, fasten seat belt, start the car and put it in reverse.\n",
      "It is usually only a few seconds that I am waiting in reverse gear for the camera to show up.\n",
      "However, since I've had a backup camera for the last 16 years, I feel uncomfortable without it.\n",
      "I eventually figured out that I had to put my seatbelt on before I could move back the car out onto the driveway to wash it.\n",
      "She had the car in park and opened the door so that she could reach.\n",
      "She does so.\n",
      "Adequate power despite having a four cylinder engine.\n",
      "Great viewing ability around the vehicle while driving.\n",
      "Features like blind spot warning and cross-traffic warning systems work so well you can feel confident about it.\n",
      "Sometimes takes minutes for Sensus to switch from the backup camera mode to populate the controls that you can even change the radio station or the navigation system or climate control.\n",
      "In warm weather, the really stupid AutoStop feature to the engine must be toggled off every single time you start the vehicle if you don't want to literally sweat all of the way to your destination because \"green\" fools decided to make you suffer with this garbage technology.\n",
      "Horrible AutoStop feature on the engine is the single worst feature of this vehicle.\n",
      "The wheels collect brake dust fast and they don't ever get clean when going through a car wash.\n",
      "I have to hand clean them weekly to get all of the brake dust out of the \"spokes\" of these wheels.\n",

      "Feel incredibly safe driving the SUV, and I look good too:).\n",
      "Mar 1, 2016A couple of features that I have been disappointed in are:\r\n",
      "Place for sunglasses so they can be stored without being damaged.\n",
      "A place to put your cell phone up under the radio or on the dash.\n",
      "Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander both have a small opening under the dash to put your phone, it can be plugged in there, handy to grab when you need it.\n",
      "I am really trying not to keep the phone in pockets anymore.\n",
      "Having it under the dash means you are not searching for it on the seat or in your purse.\n",
      "Also a safety feature.\n",
      "Garage door opener automatic\r\n",
      "Remote car start - really wanted that feature in a new car and now I only have 6 month trial and then I have to pay additional for the service.\n",
      "That is the most disappointing feature on this car, especially living in Wisconsin in a colder climate.\n",
      "Heated steering wheel is amazing - love it more than the heated seats.\n",
      "Would give up heated seats before the heated steering wheel.\n",
      "Absolutely love that you can grab the handle of the locked car and it will open if you have the fab in your pocket.\n",
      "That is a very very nice feature, especially being female and I like being able to quickly jump in my car and lock it behind me.\n",
      "Really miss a place to put your sunglasses up by the rear view mirror.\n",
      "The sensor on the door handle does not always register.\n",
      "When juggling two kids, a diaper bag, and a work bag the doors should be highly responsive to touch.\n",
      "They are not.\n",
      "There is better technology on the market and I was surprised Volvo didn't spend more time figuring out this element for the XC90.\n",
      "The \"around me\" view on the Infinity is superior, in my opinion.\n",
      "Perhaps it's another \"option\" to have the sensors on the front of the vehicle but I think it's a miss for them not to be standard.\n",
      "I prefer choosing a package and layering upgrades onto it from there based on which features I'm after that aren't in that package already.\n",
      "Spend some time in the front seats.\n",
      "While they seemed comfortable during the test drives, after sitting in them for several hours on end, I find them to be quite possibly the worst seats I have ever had in a car.\n",
      "My wife has no issues (fortunately it is her car), but I find the back seats far more tolerable.\n",
      "For example, the seats fit my wife perfectly (she's 5'-3\"), but don't fit me well (I'm 6'-2\").\n",
      "Fuel economy is lacking given the engine size.\n",
      "Jul 10, 2016Front seats are not as comfortable on long trips as I was expecting.\n",
      "The seat bottom cushion side bolsters pinch my butt; they aren't adjustable like the seat back side bolsters.\n",
      "My pelvis sits right between the rear seat bottom cushion and the front leg extensions, so my back has to be pressed into the seat back to prevent my butt from falling asleep on extended trips.\n",
      "Overall, seat comfort has been a disappointment.\n",
      "ECO mode is awful for stop/go driving, though good for the highway so long as the outside temperature isn't too hot.\n",
      "Normal day-to-day driving nets 21-22mpg over a tank.\n",
      "We use regular gas and I've learned the car wants 91 octane, so I attribute these results to the lower octane fuel.\n",
      "I haven't yet done the math to see if the higher octane fuel will improve fuel economy enough to justify the 50 cent per gallon price differential.\n",
      "3 Safety sensors, auto park, and complete sensor wiring harness front to back had to be replaced!\n",

      "The new Volvo XC90 T8 Inscription Hybrid  is an exciting fascinating powerful hi-tech comfortable safe dream of a drive!\n",
      "Having driven a 2006 Volvo XC90 V8 for ten years, there was no question that I wanted a newer more hi-tech and safer version of my otherwise comfortable and reliable 2006 vehicle.\n",

      "It drives smoothly, has superior handling, and all of the safety and driver assist technology is amazing...and the interior design and fit is second to none.\n",

      "2) Remote starting - our 10 year old Ford has a single push button on the key fob that starts the car and begins conditioning the cabin.\n",
      "If you are looking for a XC90, I would add the additional technical features like surround cameras, adaptive breaking and cruise control and upgraded wheels.\n",
      "The XC90 offers a lot of value but the extra features provide a complete experience.\n",

      "- Rear view mirror with position memory\r\n",

      "Feb 25, 2016Windshield wipers froze up on me during long trip, obstructing my visibility considerably--possibly contributing to driving into a ditch.\n",
      "Although we were offered trade assist with the first vehicle, the substandard quality of the electronics on the 2017 leaves me where I cannot recommend a Volvo product to anyone.\n",
      "Sep 25, 2016The manufacturer's willingness to assist us in switching to a 2017 XC90 from our issue-plagued 2016 is greatly appreciated and was handled in a very professional and timely manner.\n",
      "Although we love how the XC90 drives (when it is not in the shop) and its exceptional styling, we will not be purchasing another Volvo product until all of the gremlins have been worked out with future products.\n",
      "I have the Inscription package and the seating, lights and interior and exterior finishes of the car are wonderful.\n",
      "Love the 360 degree camera and all the self-driving and safety features (especially adaptive cruise control).\n",
      "The Inscription has a very comfortable ride and pleasant, well designed and crafted interior, and great looking exterior.\n",
      "I would like to see a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel added, and to improve driver access the steering wheel should move away when entering and exiting the car.\n",
      "I would also like a better low fuel warning indicater, with sound and a message to warn the driver.\n",
      "The current small yellow warning with no sound is easy to miss.\n",
      "Jul 24, 2016Safety and reliability are my first priority, with luxury and performance important but secondary if nor safe and reliable.\n",
      "It seems to be a great vehicle but you will not save money or break even on the extra amount paid for the plug-in electric features.\n",
      "This is new technology and it is difficult to get good information about how to use it.\n",
      "I went back twice to have someone run through the features and I was able to get information about what buttons to push but not about the strategy of when/how to use electric vs gas with various objectives in mind...environmental benefits vs performance vs city/highway vs cost savings.\n",
      "Also how about the auto braking available on Subaru?\n",
      "There needs to be a bit of consideration for older drivers who are not as comfortable with technology.\n",

      "We really like our car way for it's safety features and comfort.\n",
      "navigation and mileage per gallon calculation), we are starting to question the overall reliability that Volvo is suppose to stand for.\n",
      "We don't like that the auto start is always on by default and we run into issues with opening and closing our trunk.\n",
      "Would also have been nice for the car to come standard with the blind spot feature.\n",
      "There is an extreme amount of road noise, numerous malfunctions on the vehicle (gas cap not opening, keys being locked inside, brake issues within seven months of owning the car, too many computer upgrades).\n",
      "I am not happy with the vehicle at all, because it's just not the same level of quality I'm used to with the XC90 2008 model I had for seven years.\n",
      "Feb 29, 2016The only thing I don't like about the vehicle is the automatic power down feature when at a stop.\n",
      "Second seat control is not intuitive.\n",
      "Easy to confuse how to move seat forward/backward, tilt the backseat forward for rear entry, and adjust the angle of the rear seat.\n",

      "Mar 1, 2016Decision criteria: The vision safety features were a major buy-factor.\n",
      "Ability to safely do ski trip, and to have enough cargo capacity to do these trips.\n",
      "The default should be normal driving, and you CAN turn on the start/stop feature if you really want it.\n",
      "The seatbelt reminder should continue beeping after departure.\n",
      "My wife forgot her seatbelt and we realized it 20 minutes later\r\n",
      "2.\n",
      "The sensor on the masks can be displaced with high pressure water during washing.\n",
      "Depending on manner I choose for acceleration, I must use my gas pedal to shift gears to make the shifting smoother.\n",
      "I recognize that a small engine like this needs higher rpms to maintain power curve; to me, this is a trade off compared to the smoothness of a bigger engine when accelerating rapidly.\n",
      "I am very sensitive to the feel I get when driving using the different driving modes; I enjoy changing those modes.\n",
      "I wish I could lock my driving mode in place until I want to change it...rather than have it default to comfort mode whenever the engine is turned off.\n",
      "The automatic start/stop feature doesn't work properly.\n",
      "The automatic liftgate sensor doesn't seem to work properly.\n",
      "Locking the car from the interior prior to all doors being shut would also be a nice added feature.\n",
      "Having to wait for all passengers to exit the vehicle before exiting the car to lock it (besides using the key, which is usually stowed in a purse) is bothersome.\n",
      "For example, cruise control and pilot assist was once \"unavailable\" for some reason.\n",
      "The pilot assist is great, but if it disengages it should be far more obvious that it has done so-- I'm usually watching the road, not the dashboard, so simply to disengage with a very quiet tone (inaudible in some highway situations) is dangerous.\n",
      "My only feedback that is less than positive is that the air conditioning is fairly loud, and I wish the doors would automatically unlock when the car is turned off.\n",
      "It is beautiful and comfortable inside and out, and is so thoughtfully designed for the comfort and safety of passenger and driver.\n",
      "I was disappointed when I could not easily attach the back strap of our carseat to the hook on the back of the rear seat.\n",
      "The space under the headrest is too small to allow the strap to be place under the headrest without taking the latch apart.\n",
      "I was disappointed that Volvo did not think about the safety of our children when designing the rear headrest.\n",
      "Three problems: rear seat vibration noise requiring back-ordered part to fix, navigation system not working after seat repaired and had to be re-installed, passenger door handle did not recoil to flush after the door opened and remote notice that door on front passenger open.\n",
      "Apr 8, 2016The alarms on the car went off in the car wash--need a feature for car wash mode--makes it simple to press and deactivate the noise.\n",
      "The seat belt buckle rattles against the main vertical frame of the door--annoying.\n",
      "Also the second row headrests are vibrating.\n",
      "The center dash display is sometimes more cumbersome than just instruments or dials you turn by hand.\n",
      "Wish there was an engine temperature display.\n",
      "Be certain you are getting good rated tires because the tires I got were poorly rated, offered no snow traction requiring me to buy expensive snow tires and were very loud.\n",
      "Totally disappointing and really unacceptable for a luxury car, and really a cheap fix!\n",
      "One little detail I couldnt figure out yet is, with my 2015 S60, I could set the dashboard speed to miles but still could monitor gasoline consumption liters/100 km.\n",
      "This is a top quality vehicle--sporty look and feel, good fuel economy, surprisingly peppy for a four cylinder engine, and plenty of passenger and storage room.\n",
      "Above all, the safety features are outstanding.\n",
      "Offers the ability to be a pure electric vehicle for most of my daily driving and also offers flexibility for major road trips, with reasonable fuel consumption.\n",
      "There are some frustrating features that have prevented me from giving an overall better rating, mostly to do with electronic control systems (heater, wing mirror folding, voice control and navigation, weird triggering of anti-collision feature).\n",
      "It'd be nice to be able to open all the windows an inch with a single button - handy when parking the car in hot places like Southern California.\n",
      "Fun to drive, safe and comfortable.\n",
      "Only thing I wish it had was electric capability to put the 2nd and 3rd row seats up and down - can be a bit cumbersome but still worth it.\n",
      "Another option would be to allow the use of my smartphone app thru Bluetooth to use for navigation (ie Waze, Google Maps, etc).\n",
      "The iPhone app sporadically sends me (incorrect) notifications that my vehicle is unlocked.\n",
      "must be comfortable with technology.\n",
      "having the dealer cut the metal by hand to fit a trailer hitch is not keeping with the price and quality reputation Volvo represents.\n",
      "Too many software issues, expect more electronics reliability.\n",
      "Some controls need to be more accessible rather than buried in a console screen display (for example, cameras access).\n",
      "The one thing I don't like about Volvo XC 90, it sounds like a cheap 4 cylinder, and that is really troublesome.\n",
      "Please offer an economical diesel engine with much better mileage figures, like you do in European markets.\n",
      "We are still fighting to get a Driver's Profile associated with  each key and then have it adjust the seats, mirrors, radio, etc differently when each key is used.\n",
      "The largest issue is the lack of storage for the front seats (the CD player takes up too much of the already limited space between the seats).\n",
      "Again, disappointed in level of cabin noise in a luxury vehicle.\n",
      "The only thing I was disappointed in was because of our location: the vehicle did not have a heated steering wheel.\n",
      "Android auto still not installed \r\n",
      "I was born in a Volvo.\n",
      "If there was more third row space, a higher towing capacity and a better base sound system this would be THE PERFECT CAR.\n",
      "Simplify the screen and add back buttons for climate control.\n",
